/**
 * Providers Page Component
 * 
 * This page displays information about dental providers (dentists, hygienists, specialists)
 * in the system. It serves as the main entry point for provider management functionality
 * within the dashboard, allowing users to view and manage provider data.
 * 
 * The page will eventually include features such as:
 * - List of providers with key information (name, specialties, availability)
 * - Provider performance metrics and statistics
 * - Filtering and search capabilities
 * - Actions for adding, editing, or managing providers
 * 
 * Currently implemented as a placeholder with basic structure that will be expanded
 * in future development iterations.
