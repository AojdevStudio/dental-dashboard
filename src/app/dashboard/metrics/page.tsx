 * The page will eventually include features such as:
 * - Performance dashboards with key metrics (revenue, appointments, etc.)
 * - Interactive charts and visualizations
 * - Time period filtering and comparison tools
 * - Exportable reports and insights
 * 
 * Currently implemented as a placeholder with basic structure that will be expanded
