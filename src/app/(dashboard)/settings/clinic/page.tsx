 * Clinics Page Component
 *
 * This page displays information about dental clinics in the system, allowing users to
 * view, manage, and interact with clinic data. It serves as the main entry point for
 * clinic-related functionality within the dashboard.
 *
 * The page will eventually include features such as:
 * - List of clinics with key information (name, location, contact details)
 * - Clinic performance metrics and statistics
 * - Filtering and search capabilities
 * - Actions for adding, editing, or managing clinics
 *
 * Currently implemented as a placeholder with basic structure that will be expanded
 * in future development iterations.
