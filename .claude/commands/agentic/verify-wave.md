    # 1. VERIFICATION RESULTS ANALYSIS
    echo "üìã Analyzing verification results for quality insights..."
    
    ANALYZE the automated verification results:
    - shared/coordination/verification-results.json: Review all automated checks
    - Identify any patterns in verification failures across waves
    - Assess MCP tool integration effectiveness
    - Evaluate workflow quality and adherence to TDD principles
    
    # 2. MCP TOOL USAGE ASSESSMENT
    echo "ü§ñ Evaluating MCP tool integration effectiveness..."
    
    EVALUATE MCP tool usage based on wave:
    - IF Wave 1: Assess context7 usage for framework understanding
    - IF Wave 2: Analyze zen!testgen effectiveness and context7 integration
    - IF Wave 3: Review context7 pattern usage and zen!codereview impact
    - IF Wave 4: Evaluate comprehensive zen analysis and multi-model insights
    
    # 3. WORKFLOW QUALITY ASSESSMENT
    echo "üìä Assessing overall workflow quality and next steps..."
    
    PROVIDE workflow quality insights:
    - Identify strengths in current wave execution
    - Highlight areas for improvement in subsequent waves
    - Recommend MCP tool optimization strategies
    - Suggest process refinements for better outcomes
    
    # 4. NEXT WAVE PREPARATION GUIDANCE
    echo "üîÑ Preparing guidance for next wave execution..."
    
    PREPARE next wave guidance:
    - IF Wave 1 verified: Optimize Wave 2 test strategy based on task complexity
    - IF Wave 2 verified: Enhance Wave 3 implementation approach based on test patterns
    - IF Wave 3 verified: Plan Wave 4 quality review focus areas
    - IF Wave 4 verified: Prepare comprehensive cleanup and deployment strategy
