# Frontend Code Comments and Logging Task

## Context
You're working on a fitness application with a clear frontend-backend separation. The project follows JSDoc3 commenting style and uses Winston for logging. Some files like `lib/logger.ts` and `app/page.tsx` already have good examples of proper commenting and logging.

## Project Structure
The frontend consists of:
- `/app` directory (Next.js App Router)
- `/components` directory (Reusable UI components)

## Task Requirements
Your task is to add JSDoc3-styled comments and Winston logging to all frontend code files in the `/app` and `/components` directories according to these guidelines:

### Commenting Guidelines:
- Use clear and concise language
- Focus on the "why" and "how" rather than just the "what"
- Use single-line comments for brief explanations and multi-line comments for longer explanations or function/class descriptions
- Ensure comments are JSDoc3 styled (see `app/page.tsx` for examples)

### Logging Guidelines:
- Use Winston for logging (already imported as `logger` from "@/lib/logger")
- Log every logical connection and workflow of the codebase
- Use appropriate logging levels:
  - `error`: Critical failures requiring immediate attention
  - `warn`: Warning conditions that should be addressed
  - `info`: Informational messages highlighting application progress
  - `debug`: Detailed debugging information for development

## Examples
You can use these existing files as reference:
1. `lib/logger.ts` - Shows the logger configuration
2. `app/page.tsx` - Shows good examples of JSDoc3 comments and Winston logging usage

## Scope
You should ONLY focus on adding comments and logging to frontend code in the `/app` and `/components` directories. Do not modify any backend code or shared libraries.

When you complete this task, use the `attempt_completion` tool with a concise summary of what files you've updated and what changes you've made.

These specific instructions supersede any conflicting general instructions your mode might have.
