Backend Code Comments and Logging Task
Context
You're working on a fitness application with a clear frontend-backend separation. The project follows JSDoc3 commenting style and uses Winston for logging. The frontend code has already been updated with proper comments and logging.

Project Structure
The backend consists of:

/server directory with:
/api - API endpoints (NOT using Next.js API Routes)
/services - Business logic layer
/models - Data models and types
/repositories - Database access layer
Task Requirements
Your task is to add JSDoc3-styled comments and Winston logging to all backend code files in the /server directory according to these guidelines:

Commenting Guidelines:
Use clear and concise language
Focus on the "why" and "how" rather than just the "what"
Use single-line comments for brief explanations and multi-line comments for longer explanations or function/class descriptions
Ensure comments are JSDoc3 styled (see lib/logger.ts for examples)
Logging Guidelines:
Use Winston for logging (import logger from "@/lib/logger")
Log every logical connection and workflow of the codebase
Use appropriate logging levels:
error: Critical failures requiring immediate attention
warn: Warning conditions that should be addressed
info: Informational messages highlighting application progress
debug: Detailed debugging information for development
Pay special attention to logging in:
API endpoints (request/response)
Service methods (entry/exit points, key operations)
Repository operations (database interactions)
Examples
You can use these existing files as reference:

lib/logger.ts - Shows the logger configuration
app/page.tsx - Shows good examples of JSDoc3 comments and Winston logging usage
Scope
You should ONLY focus on adding comments and logging to backend code in the /server directory. Do not modify any frontend code or shared libraries.

When you complete this task, use the attempt_completion tool with a concise summary of what files you've updated and what changes you've made.

These specific instructions supersede any conflicting general instructions your mode might have.


Subtask Results
I have successfully added JSDoc3-styled comments and Winston logging to all backend code files in the /server directory as requested. This includes files in /server/api, /server/repositories, and /server/services. The comments explain the purpose and functionality of classes and methods, and logging has been implemented to track logical connections, workflows, request/response cycles, service operations, and database interactions, using appropriate log levels.
