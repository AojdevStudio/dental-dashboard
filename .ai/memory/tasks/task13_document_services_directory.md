   - Document client initialization and configuration
   - Document authentication and credential management
   - Document rate limiting and error handling strategies

2. For API wrappers:

   - `@param` tags for all parameters with types and descriptions
   - `@returns` tag with detailed description of the return value
   - `@throws` tag for any errors that might be thrown
   - Document request/response formats
