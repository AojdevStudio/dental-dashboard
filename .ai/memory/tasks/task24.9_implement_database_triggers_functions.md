## Description

Create Supabase functions for automatic user profile creation, data consistency, and audit logging.

## Details

- Create user management triggers:
  - Auto-create user profile on auth.users insert
  - Sync user updates between auth and profile
  - Handle user deletion cascades
  - Email verification status sync
- Implement data consistency functions:
  - Clinic membership validation
  - Goal progress calculations
  - Metric aggregation triggers
  - Cache invalidation triggers
- Build audit logging system:
  - User action tracking
  - Data modification logs
  - Access attempt logging
  - Compliance audit trail
- Create helper functions:
  - `get_user_clinics()` - Return user's clinic access
  - `check_clinic_access()` - Validate clinic permissions
  - `calculate_metrics()` - Compute derived metrics
  - `format_export_data()` - Prepare data for export
- Implement scheduled functions:
  - Daily metric aggregations
  - Weekly report generation
  - Monthly data cleanup
  - Periodic sync validation
- Add data validation triggers:
  - Business rule enforcement
  - Data format validation
  - Relationship integrity checks
  - Constraint enforcement
- Performance optimization:
  - Materialized view refresh
  - Index maintenance
  - Statistics updates
  - Query plan optimization
- Error handling and recovery:
  - Trigger failure logging
  - Automatic retry logic
  - Alert notifications
  - Fallback procedures

## Test Strategy

- Test each trigger individually
- Verify data consistency is maintained
- Test cascade operations
- Validate audit logs are complete
- Performance test under load

## Agent Notes

Database functions and triggers run automatically. They must be extremely reliable and well-tested to avoid data corruption.
