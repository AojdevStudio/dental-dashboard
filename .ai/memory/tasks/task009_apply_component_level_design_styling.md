description: "ARCHIVED: This task was part of extensive refactoring that is no longer needed due to the strong pivot to the new MVP plan. The current MVP plan implies a more greenfield approach for many features. Meticulously apply the new design system to all existing and new MVP components, ensuring adherence to `.dev/design-brief.md`. This involves styling typography, spacing, colors, borders, icons, and implementing responsive design and accessibility best practices. This task runs concurrently with or immediately follows MVP feature development."
