## Description

Review and update Prisma schema and database interactions post-auth refactor. CRITICAL: Current schema uses String IDs but target uses UUID + Supabase auth integration. Requires careful migration strategy.

## Details

This is a parent task that has been expanded into sub-tasks for a comprehensive database migration to align with the new Supabase auth-integrated schema design.

**Sub-tasks:**
- task24.1_schema_analysis_migration_planning.md
- task24.2_create_backup_rollback_strategy.md
- task24.3_add_new_multi_tenant_tables.md
- task24.4_update_user_model_auth_integration.md
- task24.5_implement_row_level_security.md
- task24.6_data_migration_validation.md
- task24.7_update_database_query_layer.md
- task24.8_update_api_routes_middleware.md
- task24.9_implement_database_triggers_functions.md
- task24.10_end_to_end_integration_testing.md

**Key Considerations:**
- ID type migration from String to UUID
- Integration with Supabase auth.users table
- Multi-tenant data isolation requirements
- Backwards compatibility during migration
- Zero-downtime migration approach

## Test Strategy

- Verify all sub-tasks are completed successfully
- End-to-end testing covers all user flows
- Data integrity checks pass
- Performance benchmarks meet requirements

## Agent Notes

This task serves as a tracker for the entire database migration effort. Individual sub-tasks should be completed in sequence due to their dependencies.
