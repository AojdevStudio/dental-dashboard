## Description

Ensure the necessary Supabase packages for Server-Side Rendering (SSR) authentication (`@supabase/supabase-js` and `@supabase/ssr`) are installed in the project and are of appropriate versions compatible with the Next.js application and project guidelines ([supabase-auth-setup.md](mdc:.windsurf/rules/.stack/supabase-auth-setup.md)).

## Details

1.  **Check `package.json`:** Review the `dependencies` section in `package.json` for existing installations of `@supabase/supabase-js` and `@supabase/ssr`.
2.  **Verify Versions:** If installed, check their versions for compatibility. If not installed, or if versions are outdated/incompatible, proceed to install/update them.
3.  **Install/Update Packages:** Run the command `pnpm add @supabase/supabase-js @supabase/ssr`. This will install the packages if they are missing or update them to the latest compatible versions and update `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
    *   *Note on versions:* While 'latest' is usually fine, if specific versions are required by other dependencies or project constraints, adjust the install command accordingly (e.g., `pnpm add @supabase/ssr@^0.x.x`). For now, we'll assume latest is acceptable.

## Test Strategy

-   **Verify `package.json`:** After installation/update, confirm that `@supabase/supabase-js` and `@supabase/ssr` are listed with correct version numbers in `package.json`.
-   **Verify `pnpm-lock.yaml`:** Ensure the lockfile has been updated to reflect the installed versions.
-   **Verify `node_modules`:** Confirm the packages are present in the `node_modules/@supabase/` directory.
-   **Initial Import Test (Optional):** Create a temporary test file (e.g., `test-supabase-imports.ts`) and try importing basic functions from both packages (e.g., `createClient` from `@supabase/supabase-js` and `createBrowserClient` from `@supabase/ssr`) to ensure they resolve without errors. Delete the test file afterwards. This helps catch installation issues early.
