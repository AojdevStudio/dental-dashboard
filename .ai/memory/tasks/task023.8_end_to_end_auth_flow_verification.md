## Description

Conduct comprehensive end-to-end testing of the entire Supabase SSR authentication flow. This task ensures all components of the authentication system (client utilities, server utilities, middleware, login/logout UI, route protection) work together seamlessly and securely as intended. This is the final verification step before considering the core authentication setup complete.

## Details

This task involves re-testing and verifying all aspects covered in previous sub-tasks (23.1 to 23.7) but with a focus on their integrated behavior.

1.  **User Registration (if applicable):**
    *   If a registration flow has been implemented, test creating new user accounts.
    *   Verify email confirmation if set up.
    *   Ensure new users can log in successfully.

2.  **Login Scenarios:**
    *   Test login with valid credentials (email/password, social providers if configured).
    *   Test login with invalid/incorrect credentials.
    *   Test login attempts with non-existent user accounts.
    *   Verify behavior on multiple login attempts (e.g., rate limiting if configured via Supabase).

3.  **Session Management:**
    *   Verify session persistence after closing and reopening the browser.
    *   Verify session persistence across multiple browser tabs.
    *   Test session behavior when cookies are manually cleared (should log out user).
    *   Observe token refresh mechanisms (via middleware) by monitoring network requests or Supabase client events if possible.
    *   Test session timeout/expiration if specific short-lived session policies are in place (Supabase JWTs are typically long-lived but refreshed).

4.  **Logout:**
    *   Verify successful logout from various states (e.g., from dashboard, from profile page).
    *   Ensure user is redirected to the appropriate page after logout (e.g., login page).
    *   Confirm session is properly terminated (cannot access protected routes after logout).

5.  **Route Protection & Redirection:**
    *   Re-verify all protected routes are inaccessible to unauthenticated users and redirect to login.
    *   Re-verify all public routes are accessible to both authenticated and unauthenticated users.
    *   Test edge cases with URL manipulation (e.g., trying to access protected routes with query parameters).

6.  **Error Handling:**
    *   Verify user-friendly error messages are displayed for all common auth errors (e.g., incorrect password, user not found, network errors).
    *   Check browser console and server logs for any unhandled exceptions or unexpected errors during auth operations.

7.  **Cross-Browser Testing (Basic):**
    *   Perform key auth flow tests (login, logout, protected route access) on at least two major browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) to catch browser-specific issues.

8.  **Security Checks (Conceptual):**
    *   Ensure no sensitive information (like full tokens, though Supabase handles this well) is unnecessarily exposed in client-side code or logs.
    *   Confirm that environment variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`) are correctly used and not hardcoded.

## Test Strategy

-   **User Persona Testing:** Simulate actions of different user types if applicable (e.g., new user, existing user).
-   **Test Case Document:** Create a simple checklist or use a test case management tool to track all scenarios being tested.
    *   Example Test Case: `ID: TC_AUTH_001, Description: Valid Login, Steps: 1. Navigate to /login. 2. Enter valid email. 3. Enter valid password. 4. Click Login. Expected Result: User redirected to /dashboard. Session created.`
-   **Exploratory Testing:** Beyond scripted test cases, perform exploratory testing to uncover unexpected issues.
-   **Developer Tools:** Use browser developer tools extensively (Network tab for requests/responses, Application tab for cookies/local storage, Console for errors).
-   **Supabase Dashboard:** Monitor the Auth section in your Supabase project dashboard for user activity, logs, and any reported issues.
