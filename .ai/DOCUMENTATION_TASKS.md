## Implementation Plan

All files will be documented following the JSDoc3 standard as specified in the `.windsurf/rules/.agent/commenting-guidelines.md`. Each task involves:

1. Review of the file(s) to understand functionality
2. Addition of JSDoc3 comments for:
   - Functions and methods
   - Classes and interfaces
   - Complex type definitions
   - Constants and variables where appropriate
3. Ensuring comments explain the "why" and "how" rather than merely restating the "what"
4. Removal of any outdated or misleading comments
