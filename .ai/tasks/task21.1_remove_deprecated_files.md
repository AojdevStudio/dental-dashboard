## Description

Remove deprecated files, specifically old versions of `db.ts` and `prisma.ts`, which have been replaced by updated configurations or structures.

## Details

- Delete the old `db.ts` file (likely from a previous database setup).
- Delete any outdated `prisma.ts` file if it's different from the one updated in task 19.2 (e.g., an old one at `src/lib/prisma.ts` if the new one is `src/lib/database/prisma.ts`).
- Double-check that no parts of the application are still referencing these old files.

## Test Strategy

- Confirm the specified files are deleted from the project.
- Perform a global search for `db.ts` and the old `prisma.ts` path to ensure no lingering imports.
- Run the application and perform basic operations to ensure no functionality was broken by the deletion of these files.
