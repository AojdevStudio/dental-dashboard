## Description

Establish the full Supabase authentication flow using the `@supabase/ssr` library as per project guidelines ([supabase-auth-setup.md](mdc:.windsurf/rules/.stack/supabase-auth-setup.md)). This is crucial for resolving current 404 errors on the starting page and enabling secure user access to the application. This task serves as a parent for all sub-tasks related to implementing Supabase SSR-based authentication.

## Details

This parent task encompasses the following key stages, each broken down into sub-tasks:

1.  **Package Installation & Verification:** Ensuring necessary Supabase libraries are correctly installed.
2.  **Environment Configuration:** Setting up Supabase URL and Anon Key environment variables.
3.  **Client Utilities Implementation:** Creating browser and server client utilities using `@supabase/ssr` patterns.
4.  **Middleware Implementation:** Developing authentication middleware for token refresh and route protection.
5.  **UI Implementation:** Creating basic login/logout functionality and pages.
6.  **Route Protection:** Ensuring routes are correctly protected based on authentication status.
7.  **End-to-End Testing:** Thoroughly verifying the entire authentication flow.

Refer to individual sub-tasks (23.1 through 23.8) for specific implementation details.

## Test Strategy

Overall test strategy is covered by the sum of test strategies in sub-tasks 23.1 through 23.8. The ultimate goal is a fully functional, secure, and robust authentication system that correctly manages user sessions and protects application routes according to the defined access rules. Verification will involve checking:

-   Successful user login and logout.
-   Session persistence across browser restarts and multiple tabs.
-   Correct redirection for unauthenticated users attempting to access protected routes.
-   Authenticated users' ability to access protected routes.
-   Absence of authentication-related errors in browser and server consoles.
-   Secure handling of tokens as per Supabase best practices.
