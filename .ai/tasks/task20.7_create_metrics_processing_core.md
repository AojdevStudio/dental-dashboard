## Description

Create core metrics processing files. This includes foundational logic for handling raw metric data and preparing it for analysis.

## Details

- Create files for basic metric data transformations and type definitions (e.g., `src/lib/metrics/transformations.ts`, `src/lib/metrics/types.ts`).
- Implement functions to ingest raw data from various sources (e.g., database, Google Sheets).
- Define common structures and types for metrics used across the application.

## Test Strategy

- Test data ingestion from different sources.
- Verify that raw data is correctly transformed into standardized metric structures.
- Ensure type safety and consistency for metric data.
