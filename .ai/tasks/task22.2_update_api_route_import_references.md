## Description

Modify import references in approximately 2 API route files. These files define API endpoints and will need their imports updated to reflect new locations of services, database queries, or utilities.

## Details

- Identify the 2 API route files (e.g., files in `src/app/api/`).
- Review each file and update import statements for modules such as:
  - Services or business logic layers
  - Database queries (`src/lib/database/queries/...`)
  - Authentication middleware or session utilities
  - Utility functions
- Ensure all paths are correct according to the new project structure.

## Test Strategy

- Verify that the API route files build without import errors.
- Test each API endpoint defined in these files using a tool like Postman or curl.
- Check server logs for any runtime errors when these API routes are accessed.
- Ensure the APIs return correct responses and interact with backend services as expected.
