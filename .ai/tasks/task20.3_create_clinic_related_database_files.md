## Description

Implement clinic-related database query and schema files. This involves creating files for clinic data access and potentially schema definitions.

## Details

- Create files for clinic-specific database operations (e.g., `src/lib/database/queries/clinics.ts`, `src/lib/database/schemas/clinic.ts`).
- Define functions for managing clinic records (CRUD operations).
- Consider relationships with other entities (e.g., users, providers, metrics).
- Align with the Prisma schema for clinic models.

## Test Strategy

- Write unit tests for each query function.
- Test creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting clinic records.
- Verify that relationships with other entities are handled correctly.
- Ensure error handling for database operations.
