description: Create Mermaid diagrams for API workflows and auth flows.
---

## Description

Create Mermaid diagrams illustrating key API workflows (e.g., Google OAuth flow, Google Sheets data synchronization, user creation/authentication) and general authentication/authorization patterns for inclusion in `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`.

## Details

-   Identify key complex workflows that would benefit from visual representation.
-   Design clear and concise Mermaid diagrams (sequence diagrams, flowcharts).
-   Embed these diagrams into the relevant sections of `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`.

## Test Strategy

-   Verify diagrams accurately represent the flows.
-   Ensure diagrams are readable and correctly rendered in Markdown.
