## Description

Create new authentication middleware to handle request authentication and authorization.

## Details

- Implement middleware logic to verify user sessions or tokens.
- Protect routes based on authentication status and user roles/permissions.
- Integrate with the updated auth configuration ([`config.ts`](src/lib/auth/config.ts:0), [`session.ts`](src/lib/auth/session.ts:0)).
- Ensure proper handling of unauthenticated or unauthorized requests.
- Likely to be placed in `src/middleware.ts` or a similar location.

## Test Strategy

- Test accessing protected routes without authentication (should be denied).
- Test accessing protected routes with valid authentication (should be allowed).
- Test role-based access if applicable.
- Verify correct redirection or error responses for auth failures.
