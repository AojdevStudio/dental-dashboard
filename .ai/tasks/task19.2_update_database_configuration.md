## Description

Update database configuration file: [`prisma.ts`](src/lib/database/prisma.ts:0).

## Details

- Review and update `src/lib/database/prisma.ts` to ensure it uses the correct Prisma client instance and database connection settings.
- Verify compatibility with the current Prisma schema and migration status.
- Ensure any database utility functions or helpers are correctly initialized.

## Test Strategy

- Verify the application successfully connects to the database.
- Perform basic CRUD operations on a test table to ensure connectivity.
- Check for any console errors related to database connection during startup or runtime.
