## Description

Develop core Google Sheets integration files. This includes setting up authentication, client initialization, and basic sheet interaction functionalities.

## Details

- Create files for Google Sheets API authentication and client setup (e.g., `src/lib/google-sheets/auth.ts`, `src/lib/google-sheets/client.ts`).
- Implement functions for listing spreadsheets, reading sheet metadata, and basic data fetching.
- Handle OAuth 2.0 flow for Google API access securely.
- Ensure proper error handling for API interactions.

## Test Strategy

- Test authentication with Google Sheets API.
- Test listing available spreadsheets for an authenticated user.
- Test fetching metadata for a specific sheet.
- Test reading a small sample of data from a sheet.
- Verify error handling for invalid credentials or sheet IDs.
