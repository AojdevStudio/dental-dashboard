## Description

Delete outdated directories: [`supabase/`](supabase/:0) and `temp_providers/`. These directories contain code or configurations that are no longer in use or have been migrated elsewhere.

## Details

- Delete the entire `supabase/` directory. This likely contains old Supabase client configurations or specific functions that are now handled differently.
- Delete the `temp_providers/` directory (likely `src/temp_providers/`). This was probably a temporary location during earlier refactoring stages.
- Ensure all relevant code or configurations from these directories have been migrated or are truly obsolete before deletion.

## Test Strategy

- Confirm the specified directories and their contents are deleted from the project.
- Perform a global search for `supabase/` and `temp_providers/` to ensure no lingering imports or references.
- Run the application and perform thorough testing to ensure no functionality relied on files within these directories.
