## Description

Develop a basic login page (e.g., at route `/login`) that allows users to sign in using their credentials (e.g., email and password). Implement the client-side logic for handling sign-in and sign-out operations using the Supabase browser client (created in Task 23.3). This page will serve as the primary entry point for users to access authenticated parts of the application.

## Details

1.  **Create Login Page Component:**
    *   Create a new Next.js page component, for example, `src/app/login/page.tsx` (if using App Router) or `src/pages/login.tsx` (if using Pages Router).
    *   This component should be a client component (`'use client';` if using App Router).

2.  **Design Basic UI:**
    *   Include input fields for email and password.
    *   Add a submit button for login.
    *   Optionally, include links for password reset or account creation if those flows are to be implemented soon.
    *   Include a sign-out button (this might be placed in a global navigation component later, but for initial testing, it can be on a test authenticated page or temporarily on the login page after successful login).

3.  **Implement Sign-In Logic:**
    *   Import `createClient` from `src/lib/supabase/client.ts` (or the correct path as per Task 23.3).
    *   Instantiate the Supabase client: `const supabase = createClient()`.
    *   On form submission:
        *   Call `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({ email, password })`.
        *   Handle the response: on success, redirect the user to a protected page (e.g., dashboard) or update UI state. On error, display an appropriate error message.

4.  **Implement Sign-Out Logic:**
    *   Create a function to handle sign-out.
    *   Call `supabase.auth.signOut()`.
    *   Handle the response: on success, redirect the user to the login page or home page and clear any local session state if necessary.

5.  **State Management:**
    *   Use React state (e.g., `useState`) to manage form inputs, loading states, and error messages.
    *   Consider using React Context or a state management library for global user session state if needed, although Supabase's auth client often handles session state internally, which can be listened to.

6.  **Routing/Redirection:**
    *   Use Next.js router (e.g., `useRouter` from `next/navigation` or `next/router`) for programmatic redirection after login/logout.

## Test Strategy

-   **Page Rendering:** Verify the `/login` page renders correctly with all UI elements.
-   **Form Input:** Ensure email and password fields accept input.
-   **Sign-In Success:**
    *   Enter valid credentials for an existing Supabase user.
    *   Verify successful sign-in (e.g., redirection to a dashboard page, user object available).
    *   Check Supabase logs and browser's local storage/cookies for session information.
-   **Sign-In Failure (Invalid Credentials):**
    *   Enter invalid credentials.
    *   Verify an appropriate error message is displayed to the user.
-   **Sign-In Failure (Network/Server Error):**
    *   Simulate a network error if possible, or test with Supabase services temporarily down (if feasible in a test environment).
    *   Verify graceful error handling.
-   **Sign-Out:**
    *   After logging in, click the sign-out button.
    *   Verify successful sign-out (e.g., redirection to login page, session cleared).
    *   Attempting to access a protected route after sign-out should trigger redirection by the middleware (Task 23.5).
-   **Input Validation:** Basic client-side validation (e.g., required fields, email format) can be added for better UX, though server-side validation by Supabase is key.
