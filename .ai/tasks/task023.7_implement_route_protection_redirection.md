## Description

Ensure that application routes are correctly protected based on user authentication status. This involves verifying that the middleware (implemented in Task 23.5) correctly redirects unauthenticated users attempting to access protected routes to the login page (created in Task 23.6), and allows authenticated users access. This task also covers defining which routes are public and which are protected.

## Details

1.  **Review Middleware Configuration (`src/middleware.ts`):
    *   **Matcher Paths:** Double-check the `config.matcher` array in `src/middleware.ts`. Ensure it correctly includes all paths that should be processed by the middleware (i.e., all paths except truly public assets like static files, images, favicon, etc.).
    *   **Public Path Definitions:** Inside the `middleware` function, review the `if (!user && ...)` condition. Ensure all intentionally public paths (e.g., `/login`, `/auth/callback`, `/signup`, `/forgot-password`, `/public-info-page`) are correctly excluded from the redirection logic for unauthenticated users. For example:
        ```typescript
        if (
          !user &&
          !request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/login') &&
          !request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/auth') && // For /auth/callback etc.
          !request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/signup') &&
          !request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/public-info')
          // Add other public paths here
        ) {
          const url = request.nextUrl.clone()
          url.pathname = '/login'
          return NextResponse.redirect(url)
        }
        ```

2.  **Define Protected Routes:**
    *   Identify all routes/pages in your application that should require authentication (e.g., `/dashboard`, `/profile`, `/settings`, any data-sensitive pages).
    *   These routes should *not* be listed in the public path exclusions within the middleware's `if` condition.

3.  **Test Redirection Logic:**
    *   **Unauthenticated Access to Protected Route:** Clear all session cookies/local storage or use an incognito browser window. Attempt to navigate directly to a protected route (e.g., `/dashboard`). Verify that the middleware redirects you to the `/login` page.
    *   **Authenticated Access to Protected Route:** Log in to the application. Attempt to navigate to a protected route. Verify that you are granted access and the page loads correctly.
    *   **Access to Public Routes (Authenticated & Unauthenticated):** Verify that both authenticated and unauthenticated users can access defined public routes (e.g., `/login` page itself, `/public-info-page`) without unexpected redirections.

4.  **Verify Behavior After Logout:**
    *   Log in to the application.
    *   Navigate to a protected page.
    *   Log out.
    *   Verify that you are redirected to the login page (or another appropriate public page).
    *   Attempt to use the browser's back button to return to the previously accessed protected page. The middleware should again intercept and redirect you to `/login`.

## Test Strategy

-   **Systematic Route Testing:** Create a checklist of all key public and protected routes in the application.
-   **Scenario-Based Testing:** For each route, test the following scenarios:
    *   Access as an unauthenticated user.
    *   Access as an authenticated user.
-   **Redirection Verification:** Confirm that HTTP status codes for redirections are correct (e.g., 307 Temporary Redirect or 302 Found, depending on Next.js version and specific redirect method used by `NextResponse.redirect`).
-   **URL Integrity:** Ensure that redirection URLs are correctly formed.
-   **Middleware Logs:** Check server-side console logs for any errors or unexpected behavior from the middleware during these tests.
-   **No Redirection Loops:** Ensure there are no scenarios where the user gets stuck in a redirection loop (e.g., a protected page redirecting to login, which then incorrectly redirects back to the protected page).
