## Description

Implement user-related database query and schema files. This typically involves creating files for user data access (queries) and potentially schema definitions if not solely managed by Prisma's `schema.prisma`.

## Details

- Create files for user-specific database operations (e.g., `src/lib/database/queries/users.ts`, `src/lib/database/schemas/user.ts`).
- Define functions for fetching, creating, updating, and deleting user records.
- Ensure queries are optimized and secure (e.g., prevent SQL injection if using raw queries, though Prisma helps mitigate this).
- Align with the Prisma schema for user models.

## Test Strategy

- Write unit tests for each query function (e.g., mock Prisma client and verify correct calls).
- Test creating a new user and retrieving their data.
- Test updating user information.
- Test deleting a user.
- Ensure error handling for non-existent users or database errors.
