## Description

Update import references in approximately 5 authentication action files. These files likely handle specific auth-related operations (e.g., login, signup, password reset) and need their imports updated to point to new locations of auth configuration, utilities, or database queries.

## Details

- Identify the 5 auth action files (e.g., files in `src/actions/auth/`).
- Review each file and update import statements for modules like:
  - Auth configuration (`src/lib/auth/config.ts`, `src/lib/auth/session.ts`)
  - Database queries (`src/lib/database/queries/...`)
  - Utility functions
- Ensure all paths are correct according to the new project structure.

## Test Strategy

- Verify that all 5 auth action files build without import errors.
- Test the functionality of each auth action (e.g., attempt login, signup).
- Check browser console and server logs for any runtime errors related to these actions.
