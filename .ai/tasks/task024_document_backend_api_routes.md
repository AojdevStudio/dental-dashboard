## Description

Thoroughly explore, analyze, and document the backend API routes of the dental-dashboard project in `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`. This includes route implementations, authentication requirements, request/response schemas, error handling, and identifying areas for improvement or further development.

## Details

### Completed Documentation (Initial Pass):

-   `/api/auth/session` (Placeholder)
-   `/api/google/connect` (Google OAuth)
-   `/api/google/callback` (Google OAuth)
-   `/api/google-sheets/discover`
-   `/api/google-sheets/mapping`
-   `/api/google-sheets/sync`
-   `/api/google-sheets/validate`
-   `/api/metrics/*` (Mostly placeholders)
-   `/api/goals` (Collection and Individual)
-   `/api/users` (Collection and Individual, clarified invitation flow)
-   `/api/clinics` (Collection, Individual, Statistics)
-   `/api/providers` (Collection, noted security concerns)
-   `/api/export/csv` (Placeholder)
-   `/api/export/pdf` (Placeholder)
-   `/api/hygiene-production/sync` (Noted security concerns)
-   `/api/hygiene-production/test` (Noted security concerns)

### Pending Sub-Tasks:

-   **task024.1:** Create Mermaid diagrams for key API workflows and authentication flows.
-   **task024.2:** Document deployment strategy, scalability considerations, and security best practices for the API.
-   **task024.3:** Further investigate, clarify, and potentially design/implement the full user invitation flow involving Supabase Auth.

## Test Strategy

-   Review `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` for accuracy, clarity, and completeness regarding API documentation.
-   Ensure all major API categories are covered.
-   Verify that notes on placeholders, security concerns, and pending work are clear.
