## Description

Implement metrics-related database query and schema files. This involves creating files for storing and retrieving various performance metrics.

## Details

- Create files for metrics-specific database operations (e.g., `src/lib/database/queries/metrics.ts`, `src/lib/database/schemas/metric.ts`).
- Define functions for recording new metrics, fetching metrics data (potentially with filtering and aggregation).
- Consider the structure for different types of metrics (e.g., financial, operational, patient-related).
- Align with the Prisma schema for metrics models.

## Test Strategy

- Write unit tests for metrics recording and retrieval functions.
- Test recording different types of metrics.
- Test fetching metrics data with various filters (e.g., date range, clinic ID).
- Verify aggregation logic if implemented at the query level.
- Ensure error handling for database operations.
