description: Add deployment, scalability, and security sections to API documentation.
---

## Description

Add comprehensive sections to `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` covering:
1.  **Deployment Strategy:** How the Next.js API routes are deployed (e.g., Vercel serverless functions), environment variable management, build process.
2.  **Scalability Considerations:** Potential bottlenecks, database connection pooling, serverless function limits, strategies for scaling.
3.  **Security Best Practices:** Review of existing security measures (e.g., `withAuth`, RLS), recommendations for hardening (e.g., input validation, rate limiting, secure API keys for external services like the hygiene production sync), and overall security posture for the API.

## Details

-   Research best practices for Next.js API deployment on Vercel (or target platform).
-   Analyze current codebase for scalability and security aspects.
-   Propose actionable recommendations where appropriate.

## Test Strategy

-   Ensure documentation is accurate and reflects common best practices.
-   Verify recommendations are relevant to the project's stack.
