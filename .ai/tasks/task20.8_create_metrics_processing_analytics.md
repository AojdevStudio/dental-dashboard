## Description

Create metrics processing analytics and aggregation files. This involves logic for calculating derived metrics, performing aggregations, and preparing data for reporting.

## Details

- Create files for metric calculations and aggregations (e.g., `src/lib/metrics/calculations.ts`, `src/lib/metrics/aggregations.ts`).
- Implement functions to compute key performance indicators (KPIs) from processed metric data.
- Develop aggregation logic (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly summaries).
- Prepare data structures suitable for charts and reports.

## Test Strategy

- Test calculation of various KPIs.
- Verify aggregation results for different time periods.
- Ensure accuracy of derived metrics.
- Test data formatting for reporting outputs.
