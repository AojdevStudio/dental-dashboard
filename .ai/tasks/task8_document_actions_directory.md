## Description

## Files to Document

- All TypeScript/JavaScript files in the `/src/actions` directory and subdirectories

## Documentation Requirements

Follow the JSDoc3 standard as specified in the commenting guidelines:

1. All functions must have:
   - Brief description
   - `@param` tags for all parameters with types and descriptions
   - `@returns` tag with return type and description
   - `@throws` tag if applicable

2. Types and interfaces must have:
   - Brief description
   - Documentation for each property

3. Focus on explaining "why" and "how" rather than merely restating "what"
