description: >
  Implement the branching strategy as defined in section 1 of `.dev/refactoring-plan.md`.
  This involves creating the main `feature/mvp-structure-refactor` branch and establishing
  the process for sub-branches if deemed necessary.
related_files:
  - .dev/refactoring-plan.md
  - .dev/branching-strategy.md
sub_tasks:
  - "[x] Create the main feature branch `feature/mvp-structure-refactor` from the current main development branch."
  - "[x] Document the decision on using sub-branches for incremental steps (optional but recommended in plan)."
  - "[x] Confirm the Pull Request strategy for merging into `feature/mvp-structure-refactor` and eventually into the main development branch."

## Notes

- Ensure the main development branch (e.g., `main` or `develop`) is up-to-date before creating the feature branch.
- If sub-branches are used, clearly define their naming convention (e.g., `feature/mvp-structure-refactor/app-layout`).
- The full PR strategy has been documented in `.dev/branching-strategy.md`.
