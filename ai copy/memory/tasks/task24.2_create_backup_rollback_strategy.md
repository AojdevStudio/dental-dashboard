## Description

**Task Skipped:** No backup or rollback strategy is required at this stage because the database is currently empty and contains no data. There is no risk of data loss during migration, so this task is not applicable.

## Details

- This task was reviewed and determined to be unnecessary for the current migration because there is no existing data in the database.
- No backup or rollback procedures are needed until the database contains production or critical data.
- Future migrations should revisit this requirement once data is present.

## Agent Notes

This task was skipped as there is no data in the database yet. No backup or rollback is required at this time. Migration can proceed without risk of data loss.
