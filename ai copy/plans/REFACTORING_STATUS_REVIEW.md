# Refactoring Plan Status - May 22, 2025

As requested, a review of the refactoring plan status was conducted.

**Current Standing:**

- **Accomplishments:**

  - Project initialization and core setup completed (~5% overall completion)
  - Google Sheets Integration Core (MVP Feature 3.1) implemented:
    - Secure OAuth 2.0 connection established
    - Data extraction services implemented
    - API endpoints created
    - Error handling and token refresh mechanisms in place
  - Essential KPI Dashboard Layout (MVP Feature 3.2) progress:
    - Responsive base dashboard layout implemented
    - Sidebar navigation component created
    - Basic responsive design completed
  - Multi-Tenant User Management Foundation started:
    - Supabase Auth setup completed
    - Basic RLS policies conceptualized

- **Remaining Work:**
  - **Phase 1: File Updates & Modifications**
    - Update auth configuration files (config.ts, session.ts)
    - Update database configuration (prisma.ts)
  - **Phase 2: New File Creation**
    - Create auth middleware
    - Implement database query files (5 files)
    - Create database schema files (5 files)
    - Develop Google Sheets integration files (5 files)
    - Create metrics processing files (4 files)
  - **Phase 3: File Deletions**

    - Delete outdated directories (supabase/, temp_providers/)
  - **Phase 4: Import Reference Updates**
    - Update auth action files (5 files)
    - Modify API route files (2 files)

**Next Steps:**

1. Complete Phase 1 file updates for authentication and database configuration
2. Create all placeholder files for database, Google Sheets, and metrics functionality
3. Remove deprecated files and directories
4. Update import references across all affected files
5. Verify all structural changes and test functionality:
   - Authentication flows with new SSR clients
   - Database connections with consolidated Prisma config
   - Import reference resolution
   - Application build verification

**Critical Notes:**

- Some tasks in `.ai/TASKS.md` (task002-task007) may need re-evaluation due to MVP pivot
- Current focus is between Phase 1 (Refactoring Setup) and Phase 2 (Design System Implementation)
- Architectural decision to use Supabase Edge Functions for backend processing
- Project has shifted towards a more greenfield approach for many features
