## Description

Develop Google Sheets data processing and validation files. This includes logic for mapping sheet data to internal models, validating data types, and handling synchronization.

## Details

- Create files for data mapping, validation, and synchronization logic (e.g., `src/lib/google-sheets/mapping.ts`, `src/lib/google-sheets/validation.ts`, `src/lib/google-sheets/sync.ts`).
- Implement functions to transform raw sheet data into structured application data.
- Validate incoming data against expected formats and types.
- Develop mechanisms for syncing data from Google Sheets to the application's database.

## Test Strategy

- Test data mapping for various sheet structures.
- Test data validation rules (e.g., required fields, data types).
- Test the synchronization process with a sample sheet and database.
- Verify error handling for invalid data or mapping conflicts.
- Ensure idempotency of sync operations if applicable.
