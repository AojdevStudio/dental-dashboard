## Description

Analyze current vs target schema differences, create detailed migration plan addressing ID type changes (String→UUID), auth integration, and multi-tenancy requirements.

## Details

- Analyze current Prisma schema in `prisma/schema.prisma`
- Compare with target schema requirements from `.dev/database-schema-design.md`
- Document all differences and required changes:
  - ID field type changes (String → UUID)
  - Foreign key relationships that need updating
  - New tables required for multi-tenancy
  - Tables that need auth integration
  - Indexes that need to be added/modified
- Create a detailed migration plan document:
  - Phase-by-phase migration approach
  - Rollback procedures for each phase
  - Data transformation requirements
  - Performance impact assessment
  - Downtime requirements (if any)
- Identify high-risk areas:
  - Tables with large amounts of data
  - Complex foreign key relationships
  - Potential data loss scenarios
- Define success criteria for migration
- Document rollback triggers and procedures

## Test Strategy

- Review migration plan with senior engineers
- Validate that all schema differences are documented
- Ensure rollback procedures are clear and tested
- Verify plan addresses all multi-tenant requirements
- Check that auth integration approach is sound

## Agent Notes

This is the foundation task - the quality of this analysis will determine the success of the entire migration.
