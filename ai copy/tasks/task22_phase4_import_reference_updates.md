## Description

Parent task for updating import references in existing files to reflect changes made during the refactoring process (e.g., moved files, new module structures).

## Details

- This task groups sub-tasks related to fixing import paths across the codebase.
- Ensures that all modules correctly reference their dependencies after structural changes.
- Sub-tasks:
  - task22.1_update_auth_action_import_references.md
  - task22.2_update_api_route_import_references.md

## Test Strategy

- Verify that all sub-tasks (22.1, 22.2) are completed.
- The application must build successfully without any import-related errors.
- Run linters and static analysis tools to catch any remaining import issues.
- Perform a full application test to ensure all functionalities work as expected with updated imports.
