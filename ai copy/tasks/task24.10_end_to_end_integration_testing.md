## Description

Comprehensive testing of auth + database integration across all user flows, including multi-tenant scenarios and edge cases.

## Details

- Create comprehensive test suites:
  - User registration and login flows
  - Multi-clinic user access scenarios
  - Data isolation verification
  - Permission boundary testing
- Test user journey scenarios:
  - New user onboarding
  - Clinic administrator workflows
  - Provider data access patterns
  - Report generation flows
  - Google Sheets sync operations
- Verify multi-tenant isolation:
  - Cross-clinic data access attempts
  - Shared resource handling
  - User switching between clinics
  - Admin override scenarios
- Performance testing:
  - Load test with multiple concurrent users
  - Large dataset query performance
  - RLS performance impact measurement
  - Auth session handling at scale
- Security testing:
  - SQL injection attempts
  - Authorization bypass attempts
  - Session hijacking scenarios
  - Data leakage testing
- Integration testing:
  - External service connections
  - Email notification flows
  - Export functionality
  - Scheduled job execution
- Edge case testing:
  - Network interruption handling
  - Partial migration scenarios
  - Concurrent update conflicts
  - Data corruption recovery
- Regression testing:
  - All existing features still work
  - No performance degradation
  - UI/UX consistency
  - API compatibility
- Documentation validation:
  - API documentation accuracy
  - Migration guide completeness
  - Runbook effectiveness
  - Training material updates

## Test Strategy

- Execute full test suite in staging environment
- Run automated regression tests
- Perform manual exploratory testing
- Conduct user acceptance testing
- Document all issues found and resolved

## Agent Notes

This is the final validation phase. No production deployment should occur until all tests pass and stakeholders sign off.
