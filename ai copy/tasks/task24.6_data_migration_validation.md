## Description

Migrate existing data to new schema structure, validate data integrity, and ensure no data loss during transition.

## Details

- Create migration scripts:
  - User data migration to auth-integrated model
  - Clinic data restructuring for multi-tenancy
  - Historical metrics data transformation
  - Goal data migration with new relationships
  - Integration settings migration
- Implement data transformation logic:
  - ID type conversions (String to UUID)
  - Timestamp standardization
  - Null value handling
  - Default value population
  - Data normalization
- Build validation framework:
  - Pre-migration data counts
  - Post-migration data counts
  - Data integrity checks
  - Relationship validation
  - Business rule verification
- Handle data quality issues:
  - Duplicate record detection
  - Orphaned record handling
  - Invalid data correction
  - Missing required fields
- Create migration batching:
  - Chunk large tables for processing
  - Progress tracking implementation
  - Resumable migration support
  - Parallel processing where safe
- Implement rollback data tracking:
  - Change log for all migrations
  - Original value storage
  - Reversal script generation
- Performance optimization:
  - Bulk insert operations
  - Index management during migration
  - Transaction size optimization
  - Resource usage monitoring
- Generate migration reports:
  - Success/failure statistics
  - Data quality report
  - Performance metrics
  - Issues encountered

## Test Strategy

- Run migration on test dataset first
- Validate row counts match pre/post migration
- Verify all relationships are preserved
- Test data access through application
- Validate business logic still works correctly

## Agent Notes

Data migration must be reversible. Keep detailed logs of all transformations for potential rollback needs.
