## Description

Create comprehensive RLS policies for all tables ensuring multi-tenant data isolation and proper auth context.

## Details

- Enable RLS on all tables:
  - User-related tables
  - Clinic-related tables
  - Metric tables
  - Goal tables
  - Integration tables
- Create RLS policies for each table:
  - SELECT policies for data visibility
  - INSERT policies for data creation
  - UPDATE policies for data modification
  - DELETE policies for data removal
- Implement multi-tenant isolation:
  - Users can only see data from their clinics
  - Clinic admins have broader access within clinic
  - Super admins have cross-clinic access
  - Public data handling (if any)
- Create auth context functions:
  - `auth.uid()` integration
  - `get_user_clinics()` helper function
  - `has_clinic_access()` validation function
  - `is_clinic_admin()` role check
- Handle special cases:
  - Shared resources between clinics
  - System-wide configurations
  - Audit log access
  - Report generation access
- Performance optimization:
  - Index optimization for RLS queries
  - Policy simplification where possible
  - Caching strategies for auth context
- Create bypass mechanisms:
  - Service role for admin operations
  - Migration scripts access
  - Backup procedures access
- Document policy logic:
  - Decision trees for each table
  - Access matrix documentation
  - Testing scenarios

## Test Strategy

- Test each RLS policy individually
- Verify multi-tenant isolation is enforced
- Ensure no data leakage between clinics
- Performance test with RLS enabled
- Test edge cases and bypass scenarios

## Agent Notes

RLS is critical for security. Every policy must be thoroughly tested to prevent unauthorized data access.
