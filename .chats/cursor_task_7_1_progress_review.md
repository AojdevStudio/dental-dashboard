[MODE: REVIEW]
Okay, I will review your work on task 7.1, focusing on the dashboard filtering system. I'll examine the state management, filter components, React Query integration, persistence, and utility functions you've implemented.

To start, I need to locate the files you've worked on.

I will begin by searching for the Zustand store file.

Found `src/hooks/useFilterStore.ts`. Now I'll read this file to review the filter state management.

Review of `src/hooks/useFilterStore.ts`:

**Positives:**
*   **Zustand Implementation:** Correctly uses `create` from Zustand and `persist` middleware for localStorage persistence. The `name` for localStorage is appropriate (`dental-dashboard-filters`).
*   **State Definition:** `FilterState` interface is well-defined, covering time period, date range, selected clinics, and providers, along with necessary actions.
*   **Time Periods:** All required time periods (`daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, `quarterly`, `annual`, `custom`) are included in the `TimePeriod` type and handled in `getDateRangeForPeriod`.
*   **Date Logic:** Uses `date-fns` for date calculations, which is a good choice. The logic for calculating start/end dates for each period seems correct.
*   **Default State:** Sensible default time period (`monthly`) and corresponding date range are set.
*   **Actions:**
    *   `setTimePeriod`: Correctly updates `startDate` and `endDate` based on the selected period.
    *   `setDateRange`: Correctly sets `timePeriod` to "custom" when a custom date range is applied.
    *   `setSelectedClinics`, `setSelectedProviders`: Straightforward state updates.
    *   `clearFilters`, `resetToDefaults`: Both reset the state to the default values. This is good. Consider if `clearFilters` should have a different behavior (e.g., empty, not default), but as is, it's consistent with `resetToDefaults`.
*   **`useFilterParams` Hook:**
    *   This is a good utility hook to transform filter state into a format suitable for API query parameters.
    *   Converts dates to ISO strings.
    *   Handles empty `selectedClinics` and `selectedProviders` by returning `undefined` for `clinicIds` and `providerIds`, which can be helpful for API calls to omit these parameters if not set.

**Potential Considerations/Improvements:**
*   **`getDateRangeForPeriod` for 'custom':** When `setTimePeriod` is called with 'custom', or if `default` case is hit in `getDateRangeForPeriod`, it defaults to the last 30 days. This is reasonable, but ensure this behavior is intended and documented if `setTimePeriod('custom')` is ever called directly without an immediate `setDateRange`. Currently, `setDateRange` always sets `timePeriod: "custom"`, so `setTimePeriod` is the main way predefined periods are set.
*   **Serialization of Dates in Persisted State:** Zustand's `persist` middleware will automatically handle `Date` objects. It typically serializes them to ISO strings and deserializes them back to `Date` objects. This is generally fine, but it's good to be aware of. If you encounter issues with date types after rehydration, you might need a custom `storage` option with `JSON.parse` and `JSON.stringify` revivers/replacers, but the default usually works.
*   **`clearFilters` vs. `resetToDefaults`:** Currently, they do the same thing. If `clearFilters` is intended to set filters to an "empty" or "all" state (e.g., empty date range, all clinics/providers selected or no filters applied), then its logic should differ from `resetToDefaults`. If they are meant to be identical, then having both is fine for semantic clarity.

Overall, this is a well-structured and functional Zustand store for managing filter state. The inclusion of `useFilterParams` is a good practice for decoupling API call logic.

Next, I'll look for the filter components. According to the task, they should be in `src/components/dashboards/filters/`. I'll start by listing the files in that directory.

Okay, I see `FilterBar.tsx`, `MultiSelectCombobox.tsx`, `TimePeriodFilter.tsx`, `ClinicFilter.tsx`, and `ProviderFilter.tsx`. This matches your summary.

I'll start by reviewing `MultiSelectCombobox.tsx` as it's a reusable component.

Review of `src/components/dashboards/filters/MultiSelectCombobox.tsx`:

**Positives:**
*   **Shadcn/ui Usage:** Good use of Shadcn components like `Badge`, `Button`, `Command`, `Popover`. The component structure aligns well with how these are typically composed.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Handles multi-selection logic correctly (`handleSelect`).
    *   Allows removal of individual selected items using an "X" button on badges (`handleRemove`). This is user-friendly.
    *   Displays selected items as badges within the trigger button.
    *   Provides a search/filter functionality within the popover using `CommandInput`.
    *   Includes a "Clear all selections" button when items are selected.
*   **Props:** The component accepts relevant props like `items`, `selectedValues`, `onValueChange`, `placeholder`, `searchPlaceholder`, `emptyMessage`, `className`, and `disabled`. This makes it flexible and reusable.
*   **Accessibility:**
    *   `role="combobox"` and `aria-expanded={open}` are used on the trigger button.
    *   The "X" button on badges has `sr-only` text for screen readers.
    *   Keyboard interaction for removing badges (`onKeyDown` for "Enter") is a good touch.
*   **Styling:** Uses `cn` utility for conditional class names, which is standard practice with Tailwind and Shadcn. The styling for the trigger button to adjust height based on selected items (`h-full min-h-10`) is a nice detail for handling many selections.
*   **Event Handling for Badge Removal:** `onMouseDown` and `onClick` with `e.preventDefault()` and `e.stopPropagation()` on the badge removal button is important to prevent the popover from closing or other unintended interactions.

**Potential Considerations/Improvements:**
*   **`ComboboxItem` type:** This is clear and simple.
*   **Trigger Button Display:**
    *   When many items are selected, the `div` with `flex-wrap gap-1` will wrap badges. The `max-w-[90%]` on this div is to leave space for the `ChevronsUpDown` icon. This is a common approach. Consider if very long labels within badges could still cause overflow issues or if truncation/tooltips would be needed for extreme cases (though likely fine for typical clinic/provider names).
*   **Performance with Large `items` List:** For very large lists of `items` (e.g., thousands), rendering all `CommandItem`s might have a performance impact. `Command` from `cmdk` (which Shadcn's `Command` is built upon) is generally quite performant, but if this becomes an issue, virtualization could be explored (though it would add complexity). For typical numbers of clinics/providers, this should be fine.
*   **Popover Width:** `PopoverContent` has `w-full`. This means it will take the width of its parent. The `Button` trigger is `w-full`. If the `MultiSelectCombobox` is placed in a narrow container, the popover content might also be narrow. `align="start"` helps. You could also consider `PopoverContent` props like `style={{ width: 'var(--radix-popover-trigger-width)' }}` or specific min-width if needed, but `w-full` is often a good default.

This is a robust and well-implemented `MultiSelectCombobox` component. It follows Shadcn UI conventions and provides good usability for multi-selection tasks.

Next, I'll review `TimePeriodFilter.tsx`.

Review of `src/components/dashboards/filters/TimePeriodFilter.tsx`:

**Positives:**
*   **Component Structure:** Combines a `Select` component for predefined time periods and a `Popover` with a `Calendar` for custom date range selection. This is a common and effective UI pattern.
*   **State Management:**
    *   Correctly uses `useFilterStore` to get and set `timePeriod`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `setTimePeriod`, and `setDateRange`.
    *   Local state `date` is used to manage the calendar's selection before committing to the global store.
    *   The `useEffect` hooks to synchronize `date` with `startDate`/`endDate` from the store and to update the store when `date` changes are correctly implemented.
*   **UI Components:** Good use of Shadcn/ui components (`Button`, `Calendar`, `Popover`, `Select`).
*   **Conditional Rendering:** The date range picker (`Popover` with `Calendar`) is correctly rendered only when `timePeriod === "custom"`.
*   **Date Formatting:** Uses `format` from `date-fns` to display dates in a user-friendly format ("PPP").
*   **Calendar Configuration:**
    *   `mode="range"` is correctly set for selecting a date range.
    *   `numberOfMonths={2}` provides a good user experience for range selection.
    *   `initialFocus` is good for accessibility.
    *   Closes the popover (`setIsDatePickerOpen(false)`) when a full range is selected.
*   **Responsiveness:** The `flex-col sm:flex-row` on the container div allows the select and date picker to stack on small screens and sit side-by-side on larger screens. The `w-full sm:w-[...]` classes also contribute to this.

**Potential Considerations/Improvements:**
*   **`onSelect` type casting for Calendar:** `(range) => { setDate(range as { from: Date; to?: Date }); ... }`. The `Calendar` component's `onSelect` for `mode="range"` should provide `DateRange | undefined`. `DateRange` is `{ from: Date | undefined; to?: Date | undefined; }`. The casting to `{ from: Date; to?: Date }` assumes `from` will always be defined if `range` is defined. This is generally true once a user starts selecting. However, a more type-safe approach might be:
    ```typescript
    onSelect={(range: DateRange | undefined) => {
      if (range) {
        setDate({ from: range.from || new Date(), to: range.to }); // Provide a fallback for from if needed, or handle separately
      } else {
        // Handle case where range is undefined (e.g., selection cleared)
        // setDate({ from: defaultStartDate, to: defaultEndDate }); // Or current store values
      }
      if (range?.from && range?.to) {
        setIsDatePickerOpen(false);
      }
    }}
    ```
    Or, if you're confident `range` and `range.from` will be defined when `onSelect` is called with a partial/complete selection, the current cast is okay, but it's worth noting. The key is that `setDateRange` in the store expects non-undefined `startDate` and `endDate`. The `useEffect` `if (date.from && date.to)` handles this before calling `setDateRange`.
*   **Initial `date` state:** `from: startDate, to: endDate`. This is correct for initializing the calendar.
*   **Button Text for Date Picker:** The logic for displaying "Pick a date range", single date, or date range in the button is clear.
*   **`!date && "text-muted-foreground"`:** This condition on the date picker button might never be true since `date` is initialized with `startDate` and `endDate` from the store. If `startDate` could ever be undefined from the store initially (which it can't based on `useFilterStore` defaults), this would be relevant. It's harmless as is.

This `TimePeriodFilter` component is well-implemented, integrates correctly with the Zustand store, and provides a good user experience for selecting both predefined and custom time periods.

Next, I will review `ClinicFilter.tsx` and `ProviderFilter.tsx`. Since they are likely very similar, I'll read them both.

```typescript
    onSelect={(range: DateRange | undefined) => {
      if (range) {
        setDate({ from: range.from || new Date(), to: range.to }); // Provide a fallback for from if needed, or handle separately
      } else {
        // Handle case where range is undefined (e.g., selection cleared)
        // setDate({ from: defaultStartDate, to: defaultEndDate }); // Or current store values
      }
      if (range?.from && range?.to) {
        setIsDatePickerOpen(false);
      }
    }}
```

Review of `src/components/dashboards/filters/ClinicFilter.tsx` and `src/components/dashboards/filters/ProviderFilter.tsx`:

These two components are very similar in structure, as expected.

**Positives:**
*   **Reusability:** They both correctly use the `MultiSelectCombobox` component, demonstrating its reusability.
*   **State Management:** They integrate with `useFilterStore` to get the selected values (`selectedClinics`, `selectedProviders`) and the setter functions (`setSelectedClinics`, `setSelectedProviders`).
*   **Data Fetching:**
    *   Both use `useSuspenseQuery` from `@tanstack/react-query` to fetch their respective data (clinics, providers). This is a modern approach that integrates well with React Suspense.
    *   `queryKey` is appropriately set (`["clinics"]`, `["providers"]`).
    *   The fetched data is mapped to the `ComboboxItem` format (`{ value: id, label: name }`) required by `MultiSelectCombobox`.
*   **Loading State:** The `disabled={isLoading}` prop is passed to `MultiSelectCombobox`, which is good practice to prevent interaction while data is loading.
*   **Mock Data:** The use of mock data with a simulated delay (`fetchClinics`, `fetchProviders`) is clearly marked as temporary and is helpful for development before actual API endpoints are ready.

**Potential Considerations/Improvements:**
*   **Error Handling with `useSuspenseQuery`:** `useSuspenseQuery` will throw an error if the query fails, which should be caught by an Error Boundary higher up in the component tree. This is the intended behavior with Suspense. Ensure appropriate Error Boundaries are in place in your dashboard layout or page to handle these cases gracefully.
*   **Empty State/No Data:** If `fetchClinics` or `fetchProviders` returns an empty array, the `MultiSelectCombobox` will display "No clinics found." or "No providers found." as per the `emptyMessage` prop, which is good.
*   **Placeholder Data for `useSuspenseQuery`:** While Suspense handles the loading UI, you could consider using `placeholderData` with `useSuspenseQuery` if you want to show some initial (possibly stale) data immediately while fresh data is being fetched in the background after the initial load. However, for filters that populate once, the current approach is fine.
*   **Query Invalidation:** The task description mentioned "Connect filters to React Query's queryClient to invalidate and refetch data when filters change." These filter components themselves fetch lists of clinics/providers for selection; they don't typically *cause* invalidation of other data. The invalidation would happen elsewhere (e.g., in the components that display data based on these filters, or in a higher-level effect in `FilterBar` or the dashboard page itself when `selectedClinics` or `selectedProviders` change). This aspect will be more relevant when reviewing how the main dashboard data reacts to filter changes.

These components are well-structured, make good use of React Query for data fetching, and integrate cleanly with the `MultiSelectCombobox` and the Zustand store. The use of `useSuspenseQuery` is a good choice.

Next, I will review `FilterBar.tsx`.

Review of `src/components/dashboards/filters/FilterBar.tsx`:

This component is the main orchestrator for the filters.

**Positives:**
*   **Collapsible UI:** Uses a `Card` and a button to toggle `isExpanded` state, showing/hiding the filter controls. This is good for saving screen space.
*   **Layout:**
    *   The filter controls (`TimePeriodFilter`, `ClinicFilter`, `ProviderFilter`) are placed within an `Accordion` for better organization when expanded. This is a good choice.
    *   A header section includes the toggle button, a filter count badge, and Clear/Reset buttons.
*   **State Management Integration:** Correctly uses `useFilterStore` to access filter state and actions (`clearFilters`, `resetToDefaults`, and setters for URL parsing).
*   **URL Parameter Synchronization:**
    *   `useEffect` hook with `searchParams` dependency correctly calls `loadFiltersFromUrl` to initialize filter state from URL parameters on mount or when URL changes. This supports sharable links.
    *   `updateUrlParams` function correctly constructs URL search parameters from the current filter state and uses `router.replace` to update the URL without a full page reload.
    *   The dependency array for the effect calling `updateUrlParams` and `invalidateQueries` correctly includes all relevant filter state variables.
*   **React Query Integration:**
    *   `useQueryClient()` is used to get the query client.
    *   `queryClient.invalidateQueries()` is called when filters change. This is crucial for ensuring data displayed on the dashboard updates according to the selected filters. The `predicate` function to target specific queries (e.g., containing "metrics", "kpis") is a reasonable approach, though it could be made more specific if query keys are more structured.
*   **Filter Count Badge:** The `hasActiveFilters` logic and the badge showing the number of active filter categories are good UX.
*   **Clear/Reset Buttons:**
    *   `handleClearFilters` and `handleResetFilters` call the respective actions from the store and also collapse the filter bar.
    *   "Clear" button is conditionally rendered based on `hasActiveFilters`.
*   **Apply/Close Buttons:** The "Close" and "Apply Filters" buttons in the footer of the expanded section both close the filter bar. The "Apply Filters" button might be slightly misleading since filters are applied reactively as they change (due to the `useEffect` and store updates). However, it serves as a common "confirm/close" action.

**Potential Considerations/Improvements:**
*   **`loadFiltersFromUrl` Type Safety:**
    *   `setTimePeriod(urlTimePeriod as any);`: The `urlTimePeriod` is a `string | null`. `setTimePeriod` expects `TimePeriod`. While it might work if the string values match the `TimePeriod` union, casting to `any` bypasses type checking. It would be safer to validate `urlTimePeriod` against the allowed `TimePeriod` values before calling `setTimePeriod`.
    *   Example:
        ```typescript
        const validTimePeriods: TimePeriod[] = ["daily", "weekly", "monthly", "quarterly", "annual", "custom"];
        if (urlTimePeriod && validTimePeriods.includes(urlTimePeriod as TimePeriod)) {
          setTimePeriod(urlTimePeriod as TimePeriod);
        } else if (urlTimePeriod) {
          // Handle invalid time period from URL, maybe default or log an error
          setTimePeriod(defaultTimePeriod); // from your store
        }
        ```
*   **`useEffect` for URL Loading:** The dependency array for `loadFiltersFromUrl` includes the setter functions from Zustand (`setTimePeriod`, `setDateRange`, etc.). While Zustand setters are stable and don't change, it's more conventional to list only the values that, when changed, should trigger the effect. `searchParams` is the primary driver here. The setters are used *inside* the effect. This is minor and likely won't cause issues.
*   **"Apply Filters" Button Behavior:** As mentioned, filters are applied reactively. The "Apply Filters" button essentially acts as a "Close" button. If the intent was to only apply filters *after* clicking this button (debounced/manual apply), the logic would need to change significantly (e.g., staging filter changes locally in `FilterBar` and only committing to Zustand store on "Apply"). The current reactive approach is often preferred for dashboards. If keeping the button, ensure its label doesn't confuse users. "Done" or simply relying on "Close" might be clearer if filters are instant.
*   **Query Invalidation Specificity:** The current predicate `query.queryKey.some(key => typeof key === "string" && ["metrics", "kpis", "appointments", "patients"].includes(key))` is a good start. As your application grows, you might want to structure query keys more hierarchically (e.g., `['metrics', filters]`, `['appointments', filters]`) and invalidate more precisely, e.g., `queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['metrics'] })`. The current approach is a pragmatic way to catch most data queries.
*   **Default `AccordionItem`:** `defaultValue="time-period"` opens the "Time Period" section by default. This is a reasonable choice.
*   **`hasActiveFilters` Default Assumption:** `timePeriod !== "monthly"` assumes "monthly" is the only default that means "no active time filter". If `defaultTimePeriod` in `useFilterStore` changes, this logic would need to update. It might be more robust to compare against `defaultTimePeriod` from the store or the initial state, though this is a small detail.

The `FilterBar.tsx` is a comprehensive component that handles UI, state synchronization with URL and Zustand, and triggers data refetching. The URL persistence and reactive updates are key features for a good dashboard experience. Addressing the type safety in URL parsing would be a good refinement.

The user mentioned React Query providers in the dashboard layout and a `useFilterParams` hook. The hook was in `useFilterStore.ts` and already reviewed. I'll check `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx` for the providers and general setup.

```typescript
        const validTimePeriods: TimePeriod[] = ["daily", "weekly", "monthly", "quarterly", "annual", "custom"];
        if (urlTimePeriod && validTimePeriods.includes(urlTimePeriod as TimePeriod)) {
          setTimePeriod(urlTimePeriod as TimePeriod);
        } else if (urlTimePeriod) {
          // Handle invalid time period from URL, maybe default or log an error
          setTimePeriod(defaultTimePeriod); // from your store
        }
```

```typescript
        const validTimePeriods: TimePeriod[] = ["daily", "weekly", "monthly", "quarterly", "annual", "custom"];
        if (urlTimePeriod && validTimePeriods.includes(urlTimePeriod as TimePeriod)) {
          setTimePeriod(urlTimePeriod as TimePeriod);
        } else if (urlTimePeriod) {
          // Handle invalid time period from URL, maybe default or log an error
          setTimePeriod(defaultTimePeriod); // from your store
        }
```

Review of `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx`:

This file sets up the main visual structure for the dashboard area.

**Positives:**
*   **Layout Structure:** Implements a common sidebar + header + main content layout.
*   **Responsiveness:**
    *   The sidebar (`SessionNavBar`) is hidden on mobile and toggled with a `Menu`/`X` button.
    *   Breadcrumbs are hidden on very small screens (`hidden sm:block`).
    *   Content padding and grid columns adjust for different screen sizes.
*   **Component Usage:** Uses Shadcn/ui components like `Button`, `Breadcrumb`, etc.
*   **Breadcrumbs:** Dynamically generates breadcrumbs based on the current `pathname`. The logic to capitalize segments and link intermediate parts seems reasonable.
*   **Mobile Menu:** `isMobileMenuOpen` state correctly toggles the visibility of the sidebar on mobile.
*   **Header:** Includes placeholders for Search and Notifications icons.
*   **Content Area:** Provides a scrollable `main` area for the page content (`children`). The `container mx-auto` and responsive grid for children are good starting points for widget layout.

**Missing Item from User Summary / Task:**
*   **React Query Provider:** The user's summary mentioned "Added React Query providers to the dashboard layout". **I do not see a `QueryClientProvider` in this `layout.tsx` file.** For React Query to function (including `useSuspenseQuery`, `useQueryClient`, `invalidateQueries`), the component tree needs to be wrapped in `<QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>`. This is a critical missing piece if it's not handled in a higher-level layout (e.g., `src/app/layout.tsx`) or a specific providers file.

**Potential Considerations/Improvements:**
*   **Placement of React Query Provider:** If it's not here, it *must* be in a parent component that wraps this layout. Typically, for Next.js App Router, this would be in the root `layout.tsx` or a custom `providers.tsx` file that wraps `children` in the root layout. If it's intended to be *only* for the dashboard, this layout would be a logical place, but it would need to be a client component that initializes `QueryClient`.
    *   Example (if adding here):
        ```typescript
        // At the top
        import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";
        import { ReactQueryDevtools } from "@tanstack/react-query-devtools"; // Optional

        // Inside the component, before return
        const [queryClient] = useState(() => new QueryClient());

        // In the return, wrap {children} or the main content div
        // <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
        //   {children}
        //   <ReactQueryDevtools initialIsOpen={false} />
        // </QueryClientProvider>
        ```
*   **Breadcrumb Root:** The breadcrumb always starts with a link to `/dashboard`. This is fine. The dynamic part starts after that.
*   **Styling and Accessibility:**
    *   The mobile menu toggle and header icons have `h-10 w-10` which is a good touch target size.
    *   Consider `aria-controls` for the mobile menu toggle button pointing to the ID of the sidebar and `aria-expanded` for the toggle button.
*   **`SessionNavBar`:** The implementation of this component isn't visible here, but it's the main navigation element.
*   **Dashboard Grid:** The `grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3` is a basic responsive grid. For the user-configurable widget system (Task 7.3), this will likely be replaced or augmented by a library like React Grid Layout, as mentioned in the task description.

The most critical point from reviewing this file is the **absence of the React Query provider setup.** This needs to be addressed for the filters and any data-fetching hooks to work correctly.

**Overall Summary of Review for Task 7.1 (Dashboard Filtering System):**

**Accomplishments (as per user summary and code):**
*   **Zustand Store (`useFilterStore.ts`):**
    *   Well-implemented with persistence for time periods, custom dates, clinics, and providers.
    *   Includes `useFilterParams` utility hook.
    *   Supports all required time periods and clear/reset functionality.
*   **Filter Components (`MultiSelectCombobox.tsx`, `TimePeriodFilter.tsx`, `ClinicFilter.tsx`, `ProviderFilter.tsx`):**
    *   `MultiSelectCombobox` is a robust, reusable component.
    *   `TimePeriodFilter` effectively handles predefined and custom date ranges.
    *   `ClinicFilter` and `ProviderFilter` correctly use `MultiSelectCombobox` and fetch data using `useSuspenseQuery`.
    *   Adherence to Shadcn UI and styling guidelines is evident.
*   **`FilterBar.tsx`:**
    *   Good collapsible UI with an accordion for filter sections.
    *   Successfully integrates URL-based filtering (loading from and updating URL parameters).
    *   Handles query invalidation via `queryClient.invalidateQueries()` when filters change.
*   **Persistence:** Achieved via Zustand's `persist` middleware (localStorage) and URL parameter synchronization.
*   **Utility Functions:** `clearFilters` and `resetToDefaults` are present in the store and `FilterBar`.

**Key Issues/Missing Pieces:**
1.  **React Query Provider (`QueryClientProvider`):** This is a critical omission. It was not found in `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx`. Without it, none of the React Query hooks (`useSuspenseQuery`, `useQueryClient`, etc.) will function correctly. This needs to be added, likely in a root layout or a dedicated providers file that wraps the application or at least the dashboard section.

**Minor Considerations/Suggestions:**
*   **Type Safety in URL Parsing (`FilterBar.tsx`):** Improve type checking when parsing `timePeriod` from URL parameters to avoid `as any`.
*   **"Apply Filters" Button (`FilterBar.tsx`):** The label might be confusing since filters apply reactively. Consider renaming to "Done" or "Close", or clarifying its purpose if it's just for closing the expanded view.
*   **Error Boundaries for `useSuspenseQuery`:** Ensure appropriate Error Boundaries are set up to catch errors from data fetching in `ClinicFilter` and `ProviderFilter`.
*   **`clearFilters` vs. `resetToDefaults` in `useFilterStore`:** They currently have identical behavior. Confirm if this is intended or if `clearFilters` should have a distinct "empty" state.

**Conclusion of Review:**
You've made excellent progress on the filtering system (Task 7.1). The components are well-structured, state management is robust, and features like URL persistence and reactive updates are implemented.

The most important next step is to **ensure `QueryClientProvider` is correctly set up** to wrap your dashboard application. Once that's in place, the React Query powered data fetching and invalidation should work as intended.

Do you want me to help you add the `QueryClientProvider`? I'd need to know where you prefer to set it up (e.g., in `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx` or a more global `src/app/layout.tsx` or a providers file).

```typescript
        // At the top
        import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";
        import { ReactQueryDevtools } from "@tanstack/react-query-devtools"; // Optional
