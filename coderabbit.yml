        Focus on TypeScript/React code quality aligned with Biome configuration:

        **Complexity & Code Quality:**
        - Cognitive complexity should stay under 25 (current Biome threshold)
        - Flag functions with complexity 20+ for refactoring consideration
        - Suggest breaking down complex functions into smaller, focused utilities
        - Ensure proper JSDoc comments for functions with complexity > 15

        **Type Safety (Biome Rules):**
        - Avoid 'any' types - use 'unknown' or proper type definitions
