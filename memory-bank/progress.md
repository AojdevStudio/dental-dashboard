    - Comprehensive RLS policies applied to all 21 tables
    - Helper functions created: get_user_clinics(), has_clinic_access(), is_clinic_admin(), get_user_role()
    - Performance indexes added for RLS queries
    - All tables now have row-level security enabled
    
- **Database Triggers and Functions:**
    - Auth sync triggers: Automatically sync auth.users to public.users table
    - Audit logging system: Comprehensive audit trail for sensitive operations
    - Data validation triggers: Ensure clinic membership before data modifications
    - Helper functions for permission checks and user clinic management
    
- **Scheduled Jobs Infrastructure:**
    - pg_cron extension successfully installed and configured
    - Active scheduled jobs deployed:
        - Daily aggregation (2 AM): `scheduled_daily_aggregation()`
        - Weekly reports (3 AM Mondays): `scheduled_weekly_reports()`
        - Monthly cleanup (4 AM 1st of month): `scheduled_monthly_cleanup()`
        - Hourly sync check (15 past each hour): Updates last_sync_attempt for active data sources
        - Daily statistics update (5 AM): Runs ANALYZE on key tables
        - Weekly materialized view refresh (6 AM Sundays): `refresh_materialized_views()`
    - Monitoring views for job health and execution history
    - All jobs verified as active and scheduled in production
