# Progress Tracker: Dental Practice Analytics Dashboard
*Version: 1.0*
*Created: 2025-05-17*
*Last Updated: 2025-05-18*

## Project Status
Overall Completion: ~5% (Development phase in progress)

## What Works
- Project initialized within CursorRIPER Framework.
- Core memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`) created.
- Basic project structure and configuration are in place.
- Successfully listed directory contents to verify file structures.
- Successfully read file contents to confirm exports.
- Project's command-line linting (`pnpm lint`) passes, indicating no critical lint errors in the codebase from that perspective.
- Basic interaction protocol with the AI assistant is established.
- **Google Sheets Integration (Task 4 / PRD Phase 1):**
    - Google Cloud Project and OAuth configuration set up.
    - Google Sheets authentication and token management implemented.
    - Services for spreadsheet discovery and data extraction developed (listSpreadsheets, getSpreadsheetMetadata, readSheetData).
    - API endpoints for Google Sheets operations created (`/api/google/sheets`, `/api/google/sheets/[spreadsheetId]`, `/api/google/sheets/[spreadsheetId]/data`).
    - UI components for connecting to Google Sheets built (`SheetConnector.tsx` for selection and mapping, `DataPreview.tsx` for displaying extracted data).
    - Error handling for API failures and token refresh mechanisms are in place.
    - All aspects of the Google Sheets integration as outlined in Task 4 are functional and complete.
- **Dashboard Layout & Navigation (Task 7 / PRD Phase 3):**
    - Responsive dashboard layout implemented with Tailwind CSS flex/grid.
    - Sidebar navigation component created with collapsible functionality.
    - Proper responsive design for different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
    - Mobile menu toggle for sidebar visibility.
    - Breadcrumb component for navigation context.
    - Navigation structure aligned with PRD KPI categories and dental practice workflow.
    - Placeholder content areas for future dashboard widgets.
    - Responsive behavior tested and verified:
        - Sidebar properly toggles on mobile and expands on desktop
        - Grid layout adapts from 1 column (mobile) to 3 columns (desktop)
        - Spacing and padding adjust appropriately across breakpoints
        - Navigation remains accessible on all device sizes
        - Touch targets sized appropriately (40px minimum) for mobile interfaces
        - Content properly contained and spaced on extra-small viewports (320px)
        - Appropriate hiding/showing of UI elements based on screen size

## What's In Progress
- Setting up individual dashboard pages for navigation links.
- Creating visualization components for different KPI categories.

## What's Left To Build
(High-level development phases from PRD)
- **Phase 2: Data Processing & Storage:** [PRIORITY: HIGH] - Includes column mapping UI, data transformation, historical import, scheduled sync, error handling, validation.
- **Phase 3: Dashboard Foundation & Core Visualizations:** [PRIORITY: MEDIUM] - Layout foundation implemented, still need chart components, filtering, initial financial KPI visuals.
- **Phase 4: Advanced Visualizations & Features:** [PRIORITY: LOW] - Includes complete KPI visualization set, goal tracking, comparison views, export, saved views.
- **Phase 5: Form-Based Reporting (Future Phase):** [PRIORITY: VERY LOW] - Includes form builder, mobile forms, validation, integration with metrics DB.

## Known Issues
- 404 errors when navigating to some sidebar links as the corresponding routes aren't implemented yet.
- Potential challenge: Managing scope and timeline for a comprehensive PRD.

## Decisions Made
- Organized sidebar navigation into logical groups based on PRD requirements.
- Used responsive design patterns with Tailwind CSS for layout.
- Implemented collapsible sidebar to maximize content area on all device sizes.
- Structured navigation to reflect dental practice workflow and KPI categories.

## Milestones
- **Milestone 1:** Completion of START Phase & Transition to DEVELOPMENT Phase - Due: 2025-05-17 - STATUS: Complete
- **Milestone 2:** Completion of PRD Phase 1 (Foundation & Google Sheets Integration) - STATUS: Done
- **Milestone 3:** Completion of PRD Phase 2 (Data Processing & Storage) - STATUS: Not Started
- **Milestone 4:** Completion of PRD Phase 3 (Dashboard Foundation & Core Visualizations) - STATUS: In Progress
  - Task 7: Implement Base Dashboard Layout with Navigation - STATUS: Complete
  - Remaining tasks: Chart components, filtering, KPI visualizations
- **Milestone 5:** Completion of PRD Phase 4 (Advanced Visualizations & Features) - STATUS: Not Started
