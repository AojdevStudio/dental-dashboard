  - Support for multiple OAuth providers
  - Secure token storage in data source records

### **Database Infrastructure (MAINTAINED)**
- **Multi-Tenant UUID Architecture:**
  - Successfully migrated from single-tenant String-based IDs to multi-tenant UUID-based architecture
  - All tables support UUID primary keys with backward compatibility via id_mappings table
  - Migration completed in 8 phases as documented in docs/migration/

- **Row Level Security (RLS) Implementation:**
  - Comprehensive RLS policies applied to all 21 tables
  - Helper functions: get_user_clinics(), has_clinic_access(), is_clinic_admin(), get_user_role()
  - Performance indexes added for RLS queries
  - All tables have row-level security enabled

- **Scheduled Jobs Infrastructure:**
  - pg_cron extension successfully installed and configured
  - Active scheduled jobs for daily aggregation, weekly reports, monthly cleanup
  - Monitoring views for job health and execution history
  - All jobs verified as active and scheduled in production

## What's In Progress

- **Core KPI Visualization Components:**
  - Planning implementation of Recharts-based visualization components
  - Designing dashboard widgets for financial, patient, and appointment metrics
  - Preparing integration with real data from Google Sheets pipeline

- **Google Sheets Data Transformation Pipeline:**
  - Column mapping templates development in progress
  - Data transformation logic using Supabase Edge Functions
  - Integration with existing metrics calculation engine
