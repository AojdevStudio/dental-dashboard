# Progress Tracker: Dental Practice Analytics Dashboard
*Version: 1.0*
*Created: 2025-05-17*

## Project Status
Overall Completion: ~5% (Development phase in progress)

## What Works
- Project initialized within CursorRIPER Framework.
- Core memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`) created.
- Basic project structure and configuration are in place.
- **Google Sheets Integration Core (MVP Feature 3.1 / PRD Phase MVP-1 & MVP-2 elements):**
    - Secure OAuth 2.0 connection to Google Sheets API established.
    - Services for data extraction from Google Sheets implemented.
    - API endpoints for Google Sheets operations created.
    - Error handling for API failures and token refresh mechanisms are in place.
    - Task 4 (Google Sheets API Service and Routes) from `.ai/TASKS.md` is complete.
- **Essential KPI Dashboard Layout (Part of MVP Feature 3.2 / PRD Phase MVP-3 elements):**
    - Responsive base dashboard layout implemented (`src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx`).
    - Sidebar navigation component created (`src/components/ui/sidebar.tsx`) with MVP-focused sections.
    - Basic responsive design for different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
    - Placeholder content areas for future dashboard widgets.
    - Task 7 (Base Dashboard Layout) from `.ai/TASKS.md` is complete.
- **Multi-Tenant User Management Foundation (Part of MVP Feature 3.3 / PRD Phase MVP-1 elements):**
    - Supabase Auth setup for user authentication.
    - Basic RLS policies for data isolation conceptualized (implementation pending detailed tasks).

## What's In Progress
- According to `.ai/TASKS.md`, the project is currently between Phase 1 (Refactoring Setup & Prerequisites - largely superseded by new MVP direction but foundational elements like branching are done) and Phase 2 (Design System Implementation - foundational styling and component usage are implicitly part of dashboard layout).
- The immediate next steps align with starting PRD Phase MVP-2: Core Google Sheets Integration & Data Pipeline, focusing on: 
    - Implementing pre-defined column mapping templates for Google Sheets.
    - Building the initial data transformation and synchronization pipeline using Supabase Edge Functions.
    - Storing standardized data in metrics tables (as defined in `.dev/database-schema-metrics.md`).

## What's Left To Build (MVP Focus)
(Based on `.dev/prd-mvp.md` and `.dev/mvp.md`)

- **Google Sheets Integration - Remaining (PRD Phase MVP-2):**
    - Implement pre-defined column mapping templates (details in `.dev/feature-spec.md`).
    - Build full data transformation pipeline (Supabase Edge Functions).
    - Store standardized data in metrics tables (`.dev/database-schema-metrics.md`).
- **Essential KPI Calculation & Fixed Dashboards (PRD Phase MVP-3):**
    - Develop backend logic (Supabase Edge Functions, API Routes) for calculating all core MVP KPIs.
    - Implement fixed, role-based dashboard UIs using ShadCN UI and Recharts, populated with live data.
    - Integrate basic filtering (time, clinic, provider).
- **Data Synchronization & Processing - MVP Scope (PRD Phase MVP-2 & MVP-4):**
    - Scheduled data synchronization (Supabase cron jobs).
    - MVP-scoped historical data import (e.g., < 1000 rows).
    - Data validation and error handling with logging.
    - Metric calculation engine for core KPIs (Supabase Edge Functions).
- **Multi-Tenant User Management - Refinement (PRD Phase MVP-4):**
    - Refine user invitation and management systems.
    - Fully implement and test RLS policies for multi-tenancy.
    - Provider association.
- **Basic Goal Tracking & Reporting (PRD Phase MVP-4):**
    - Implement MVP-level goal definition (data models in `.dev/database-schema-metrics.md`).
    - Display progress on fixed dashboards.
- **Testing, Refinement & Deployment Prep (PRD Phase MVP-5):**
    - End-to-end testing of all MVP features.
    - Performance testing for 50 concurrent users.
    - Finalize documentation.

## Known Issues
- Some tasks in `.ai/TASKS.md` (e.g., task002-task007 related to extensive refactoring) may need re-evaluation or archiving due to the strong pivot to the new MVP plan. The current MVP plan implies a more greenfield approach for many features.
- Placeholder pages for many navigation links will result in 404s until implemented.

## Decisions Made
- Sidebar navigation structure aligned with MVP core feature areas.
- Architectural decision to heavily leverage Supabase Edge Functions for backend processing for the MVP.

## Milestones (Aligned with MVP Phases from `.dev/prd-mvp.md`)
- **Milestone 1: MVP Phase 1 - Foundation & Core Setup** - STATUS: Partially Complete (Project infra, DB schema conceptualized, Auth setup, initial Google Sheets API connection).
    - Task `task001_branching_strategy_setup.md` (from `.ai/TASKS.md`) is complete.
- **Milestone 2: MVP Phase 2 - Core Google Sheets Integration & Data Pipeline** - STATUS: To Start (Tasks like implementing mapping, transformation pipeline).
    - Elements of Task 4 (Google Sheets API Services from `.ai/TASKS.md`) contribute here and are complete.
- **Milestone 3: MVP Phase 3 - Essential KPI Calculation & Fixed Dashboards** - STATUS: To Start (Layout foundation from Task 7 is done, but KPI logic, charts, and data integration are pending).
- **Milestone 4: MVP Phase 4 - Basic Goal Tracking & User Management Refinement** - STATUS: To Start.
- **Milestone 5: MVP Phase 5 - Testing, Refinement & Deployment Prep** - STATUS: To Start.
