### Major Infrastructure Updates (2025-05-27 - 2025-05-28)
- **Database Migration to Multi-Tenant UUID Architecture:**
    - Successfully migrated from single-tenant String-based IDs to multi-tenant UUID-based architecture
    - All tables now support UUID primary keys with backward compatibility via id_mappings table
    - Migration completed in 8 phases as documented in docs/migration/complete-migration-summary.md
    
- **Row Level Security (RLS) Implementation:**
    - Comprehensive RLS policies applied to all 21 tables
    - Helper functions created: get_user_clinics(), has_clinic_access(), is_clinic_admin(), get_user_role()
    - Performance indexes added for RLS queries
    - All tables now have row-level security enabled
    
- **Database Triggers and Functions:**
    - Auth sync triggers: Automatically sync auth.users to public.users table
    - Audit logging system: Comprehensive audit trail for sensitive operations
    - Data validation triggers: Ensure clinic membership before data modifications
    - Helper functions for permission checks and user clinic management
    
- **Scheduled Jobs Infrastructure:**
    - pg_cron extension successfully installed and configured
    - Active scheduled jobs deployed:
        - Daily aggregation (2 AM): `scheduled_daily_aggregation()`
        - Weekly reports (3 AM Mondays): `scheduled_weekly_reports()`
        - Monthly cleanup (4 AM 1st of month): `scheduled_monthly_cleanup()`
        - Hourly sync check (15 past each hour): Updates last_sync_attempt for active data sources
        - Daily statistics update (5 AM): Runs ANALYZE on key tables
        - Weekly materialized view refresh (6 AM Sundays): `refresh_materialized_views()`
    - Monitoring views for job health and execution history
    - All jobs verified as active and scheduled in production

- **Complete Database Migration & Auth Integration (Task 24) - COMPLETED:**
    - ✅ Schema analysis and migration planning completed
    - ✅ Multi-tenant tables added with proper relationships
    - ✅ User model updated for Supabase auth integration
    - ✅ Comprehensive RLS policies implemented across all tables
    - ✅ Data migration and validation completed successfully
    - ✅ Database query layer updated for auth-integrated schema
    - ✅ API routes and middleware updated with RLS-aware data access
    - ✅ Database triggers and functions implemented
    - ✅ End-to-end integration testing completed

## What's In Progress
- **Database Infrastructure Complete:**
    - Multi-tenant UUID architecture fully deployed to production
    - All 23 tables migrated and verified with proper constraints
    - RLS policies active on all sensitive tables (users, clinics, providers, goals, metric_values, audit_logs)
    - Helper functions operational: get_user_clinics(), has_clinic_access(), is_clinic_admin(), get_user_role()
    - Audit logging system capturing all sensitive operations
    - Database triggers ensuring data integrity and auth synchronization
    - Scheduled jobs running on defined schedules for maintenance and aggregation
- The immediate next steps align with starting PRD Phase MVP-2: Core Google Sheets Integration & Data Pipeline, focusing on: 
    - Implementing pre-defined column mapping templates for Google Sheets.
    - Building the initial data transformation and synchronization pipeline using Supabase Edge Functions.
    - Storing standardized data in metrics tables (as defined in `.dev/database-schema-metrics.md`).
    - Updating existing API routes and services to work with the new UUID-based schema

## What's In Progress
- **Ready to Begin MVP Development:**
    - ✅ Complete database infrastructure with multi-tenant UUID architecture
    - ✅ Full auth integration with Supabase SSR
    - ✅ RLS policies and security measures in place
    - ✅ Scheduled jobs and monitoring infrastructure operational
    
- **Next Phase: MVP Feature Development**
    - Ready to start PRD Phase MVP-2: Core Google Sheets Integration & Data Pipeline
    - Focus areas:
        - Implementing pre-defined column mapping templates for Google Sheets
        - Building data transformation and synchronization pipeline using Supabase Edge Functions
        - Storing standardized data in metrics tables (as defined in `.dev/database-schema-metrics.md`)
        - Creating MVP dashboard components with live data integration

## What's Left To Build (MVP Focus)
(Based on `.dev/prd-mvp.md` and `.dev/mvp.md`)

- **Google Sheets Integration - Remaining (PRD Phase MVP-2):**
    - Implement pre-defined column mapping templates (details in `.dev/feature-spec.md`).
    - Build full data transformation pipeline (Supabase Edge Functions).
    - Store standardized data in metrics tables (`.dev/database-schema-metrics.md`).
- **Essential KPI Calculation & Fixed Dashboards (PRD Phase MVP-3):**
    - Develop backend logic (Supabase Edge Functions, API Routes) for calculating all core MVP KPIs.
    - Implement fixed, role-based dashboard UIs using ShadCN UI and Recharts, populated with live data.
    - Integrate basic filtering (time, clinic, provider).
- **Data Synchronization & Processing - MVP Scope (PRD Phase MVP-2 & MVP-4):**
    - Scheduled data synchronization (Supabase cron jobs).
    - MVP-scoped historical data import (e.g., < 1000 rows).
    - Data validation and error handling with logging.
    - Metric calculation engine for core KPIs (Supabase Edge Functions).
- **Multi-Tenant User Management - Refinement (PRD Phase MVP-4):**
    - Refine user invitation and management systems.
    - Fully implement and test RLS policies for multi-tenancy.
    - Provider association.
- **Basic Goal Tracking & Reporting (PRD Phase MVP-4):**
    - Implement MVP-level goal definition (data models in `.dev/database-schema-metrics.md`).
    - Display progress on fixed dashboards.
- **Testing, Refinement & Deployment Prep (PRD Phase MVP-5):**
    - End-to-end testing of all MVP features.
    - Performance testing for 50 concurrent users.
    - Finalize documentation.

## Known Issues
- Placeholder pages for many navigation links will result in 404s until implemented.
- Migration Learnings:
    - Supabase MCP has limitations with complex DDL statements requiring alternative approaches
    - Auth schema permissions require using public schema for custom functions
    - Supabase CLI is the most reliable method for applying complex migrations
    - pg_cron job management requires specific column names (jobid not job_id)

## Decisions Made
- Sidebar navigation structure aligned with MVP core feature areas.
- Architectural decision to heavily leverage Supabase Edge Functions for backend processing for the MVP.
- Database Migration Decisions:
    - Use public schema for all custom functions to avoid auth schema permission issues
    - Implement comprehensive RLS with helper functions for performance
    - Use table aliases in RLS policies to prevent ambiguous column references
    - Archive Prisma migrations to prevent re-execution by Supabase CLI
    - Implement robust error handling in migration scripts for idempotency

## Milestones (Aligned with MVP Phases from `.dev/prd-mvp.md`)
- **Milestone 1: MVP Phase 1 - Foundation & Core Setup** - STATUS: Partially Complete (Project infra, DB schema conceptualized, Auth setup, initial Google Sheets API connection).
    - Task `task001_branching_strategy_setup.md` (from `.ai/TASKS.md`) is complete.
- **Milestone 2: MVP Phase 2 - Core Google Sheets Integration & Data Pipeline** - STATUS: To Start (Tasks like implementing mapping, transformation pipeline).
    - Elements of Task 4 (Google Sheets API Services from `.ai/TASKS.md`) contribute here and are complete.
- **Milestone 3: MVP Phase 3 - Essential KPI Calculation & Fixed Dashboards** - STATUS: To Start (Layout foundation from Task 7 is done, but KPI logic, charts, and data integration are pending).
- **Milestone 4: MVP Phase 4 - Basic Goal Tracking & User Management Refinement** - STATUS: To Start.
- **Milestone 5: MVP Phase 5 - Testing, Refinement & Deployment Prep** - STATUS: To Start.
