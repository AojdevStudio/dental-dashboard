# Project Brief: Dental Practice Analytics Dashboard
*Version: 1.0*
*Created: 2025-05-17*
*Last Updated: 2025-05-17*

## Project Overview
The Dental Practice Analytics Dashboard is a centralized web application designed to visualize and analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) from dental practices. It connects to existing Google Spreadsheets via API, transforms raw data into actionable insights, and presents them through intuitive visualizations. The system will initially serve as a read-only dashboard and eventually evolve into a complete reporting platform with form-based data entry, replacing the current spreadsheet-based workflow. This solution addresses the critical need for cohesive data analysis across multiple dental practices and provides real-time performance visibility against established goals.

## Core Requirements
- Securely connect to Google Sheets API using OAuth.
- Provide a visual interface for mapping spreadsheet columns to system metrics.
- Automate data synchronization with configurable frequency.
- Implement a data transformation pipeline for normalizing and standardizing information.
- Support historical data import and incremental updates.
- Display interactive dashboards for financial metrics (production, collections, payments).
- Enable provider performance analysis (production, treatment planning, procedure statistics).
- Show patient metrics (active patients, new patients, recare rates).
- Provide appointment analytics (total appointments, hygiene breakdown, cancellation rates).
- Track call performance (unscheduled treatment, hygiene reactivation).
- Report on treatment plan acceptance and conversion.
- Allow multi-level filtering: clinic-level, provider-specific, time-based (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual).
- Implement goal tracking and variance reporting.
- Provide trend analysis with historical comparisons.
- Offer role-based dashboard templates.
- Allow user-configurable widgets and layouts.
- Enable saved views for frequently accessed reports.
- Provide export capabilities for presentations and meetings.
- (Future Phase) Develop a custom form builder for different data collection needs.
- (Future Phase) Implement data validation and business rule enforcement for form-based entry.
- (Future Phase) Support gradual migration from spreadsheet-based to form-based reporting.

## Success Criteria
- Real-time visibility into practice performance against established goals.
- Cohesive data analysis across multiple dental practices.
- Reduction in manual data aggregation and reporting efforts.
- Improved operational efficiency through actionable insights.
- Successful replacement of spreadsheet-based workflow with form-based data entry (in later phases).
- High adoption and satisfaction rates among Office Managers, Dentists/Providers, and Front Desk Staff.

## Scope
### In Scope
- Integration with Google Sheets for data extraction.
- Visualization of key dental practice KPIs.
- Multi-level filtering and analysis.
- Customizable dashboards and reporting features.
- User roles and permissions (Office Manager, Dentist/Provider, Front Desk Staff, Admin).
- Initial read-only dashboard functionality.
- Future development of form-based data entry.

### Out of Scope
- Direct integration with Practice Management Software (PMS) beyond Google Sheets.
- Patient scheduling or direct patient communication tools.
- Billing or insurance claim processing.
- Advanced AI-driven predictive analytics (beyond trend analysis).

## Timeline
(Based on PRD - Development Phases)
- **Phase 1: Foundation & Google Sheets Integration:** 4-6 weeks
- **Phase 2: Data Processing & Storage:** 3-4 weeks
- **Phase 3: Dashboard Foundation & Core Visualizations:** 4-5 weeks
- **Phase 4: Advanced Visualizations & Features:** 3-4 weeks
- **Phase 5: Form-Based Reporting (Future Phase):** 5-6 weeks

## Stakeholders
- **Office Managers:** Overall practice performance monitoring, financial oversight, staff management.
- **Dentists/Providers:** Individual performance metrics, treatment planning effectiveness, patient-related statistics.
- **Front Desk Staff:** Appointment metrics, patient statistics, call performance data.
