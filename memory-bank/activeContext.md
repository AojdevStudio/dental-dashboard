*Current RIPER Mode: REVIEW (Completed comprehensive auth and integration updates)*

## Active Context (RIPER Workflow)

**Current Mode:** REVIEW (Completed major authentication and integration updates)
**Current Focus:** Comprehensive authentication system with multi-step registration, OAuth integration, and Google Sheets testing infrastructure.
**Key Objectives:** 
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive multi-step registration form with clinic association
- ✅ Enhanced authentication with database verification and proper error handling
- ✅ Integrated Google OAuth for Google Sheets access
- ✅ Built robust Google Sheets testing infrastructure
- ✅ Implemented proper loading and error states for auth pages

**Recent Major Updates:**
- **Authentication System Overhaul:**
  - Enhanced `signInWithVerification` with comprehensive database user verification
  - Implemented proper auth-to-database user mapping with UUID migration support
  - Added clinic and role verification during login process
  - Integrated Google OAuth with proper callback handling
  - Added comprehensive error handling and user feedback

- **Multi-Step Registration System:**
  - Created `RegisterFormComprehensive` component with 3-step process:
    1. Account Information (email, password, name, phone)
    2. Role & Clinic Setup (role selection, join/create clinic, provider info)
    3. Terms & Agreements (legal acceptance, registration summary)
  - Implemented clinic creation and joining via registration codes
  - Added provider-specific fields for dentist roles
  - Integrated with comprehensive registration API endpoint

- **Google Sheets Integration Infrastructure:**
  - Built comprehensive testing page (`/integrations/google-sheets/test`)
  - Implemented OAuth flow for Google Sheets access
  - Created data source management with token storage
  - Added spreadsheet discovery and metadata fetching
  - Built sheet data extraction with range support
  - Implemented proper error handling and debugging tools

**Relevant Files & Rules:**
- `src/components/auth/register-form-comprehensive.tsx` - Multi-step registration form
- `src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` - Enhanced login page with OAuth
- `src/app/auth/actions.ts` - Enhanced authentication actions
- `src/actions/auth/oauth.ts` - OAuth provider integration
- `src/app/api/auth/register-comprehensive/route.ts` - Registration API
- `src/app/(dashboard)/integrations/google-sheets/test/page.tsx` - Google Sheets testing
- `src/app/api/google/sheets/test-noauth/route.ts` - Google Sheets API testing

**Architecture Improvements:**
- Proper separation of client and server components
- Enhanced error boundaries with loading states
- Comprehensive form validation and user feedback
- Secure token management for Google Sheets integration
- Multi-tenant clinic association during registration

**Next Steps:**
1. **Production Readiness:** Review and test all authentication flows end-to-end
2. **Google Sheets Pipeline:** Implement the data transformation pipeline using the testing infrastructure
3. **Dashboard Integration:** Connect the Google Sheets data to dashboard components
4. **User Management:** Implement user invitation and role management features
5. **Error Monitoring:** Add comprehensive logging and monitoring for production

## Recent Changes
- 2025-01-15: REVIEW: Completed comprehensive authentication and Google Sheets integration updates
  - Enhanced login with database verification and OAuth support
  - Implemented multi-step registration with clinic association

## Mode: REVIEW

**Objective:** Document and validate the comprehensive authentication and integration system updates.

**Current Task:** Memory bank update to reflect the new authentication architecture and Google Sheets integration capabilities.

**Current Focus:** Ensuring all changes are properly documented and next steps are clearly defined.

**Blockers:** None. System is ready for next phase of development.

**Next Steps (for Developer):**

- Verify Google OAuth integration works end-to-end
- Test Google Sheets data extraction with real spreadsheets
- Review error handling and user feedback mechanisms
- Plan the data transformation pipeline implementation
- Consider implementing user invitation system for clinic administrators
