# Active Context: Dental Practice Analytics Dashboard
*Version: 1.3*
*Created: 2025-05-17*
*Last Updated: 2025-06-14*
*Current RIPER Mode: EXECUTE (Implementing core dashboard functionality)*

## Active Context (RIPER Workflow)

**Current Mode:** EXECUTE (Implementing core dashboard layout and navigation)
**Current Focus:** Enhanced dashboard layout with comprehensive navigation structure and performance optimization.
**Key Objectives:** 
- âœ… Implemented comprehensive dashboard layout with collapsible sidebar and top navigation
- âœ… Completed dashboard performance optimization with caching strategies
- âœ… Enhanced navigation components with persistent state management
- âœ… Integrated React Query for optimized data fetching and caching
- ðŸ”„ Working on Google Sheets data pipeline integration
- ðŸ”„ Implementing core KPI visualization components

**Recent Major Updates:**

- **Dashboard Layout & Navigation System (NEW - 2025-06-03):**
  - Implemented comprehensive dashboard layout with collapsible sidebar
  - Created navigation components with consistent design patterns
  - Added state management for sidebar persistence across sessions
  - Enhanced top navigation with user dropdown and responsive design
  - Updated global styles with smooth transitions and focus states

- **Dashboard Performance Optimization (NEW - 2025-06-03):**
  - Achieved significant performance improvements (1.7s to 24-42ms for subsequent loads)
  - Integrated React Query for caching main data entities
  - Implemented API caching headers for key routes
  - Created skeleton loading components for improved perceived performance
  - Added optimistic updates and background refetching capabilities

- **Google Sheets Integration Enhancement:**
  - Enhanced hygiene production tracking with auto-extraction from sheet titles
  - Improved provider name extraction from Google Sheets
  - Updated Google Apps Script functionality for better integration
  - Refined data synchronization processes

- **Code Quality & Type Safety Fixes (NEW - 2025-06-14):**
  - Resolved all `noExplicitAny` and related TypeScript errors in `src/lib/database/queries/providers.ts`.
  - Defined strict interfaces for raw SQL query results and accumulator types, eliminating untyped `any` usage.
  - Replaced `any[]` query parameter arrays with `unknown[]` and added explicit casting for parsing.

- **Supabase Backend Scaffolding (NEW - 2025-06-14):**
  - Generated directory placeholders for Supabase Edge Functions under `supabase/functions/` covering audit-logging, data-export, goal-tracking, metrics-calculation, and scheduled-sync.
  - Added initial SQL migration placeholders under `supabase/migrations/` plus a project-level `supabase/config.toml`.
  - These scaffolds establish a clear path for future server-side business logic without affecting current MVP scope.

**Key Infrastructure Files:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` - Main dashboard layout structure
- `src/app/(dashboard)/layout-client.tsx` - Client-side layout components
- `src/components/common/dashboard-layout.tsx` - Core dashboard layout component
- `src/components/common/sidebar.tsx` - Collapsible sidebar navigation
- `src/components/common/top-nav.tsx` - Top navigation bar
- `src/components/common/nav-item.tsx` - Navigation item components
- `src/components/common/user-dropdown.tsx` - User account dropdown
- `src/lib/types/layout.ts` - Layout type definitions
- `src/lib/types/navigation.ts` - Navigation type definitions
- `src/lib/utils/navigation.ts` - Navigation utility functions

**Performance Improvements:**
- React Query integration with automatic caching and background updates
- API response caching with appropriate headers
- Skeleton loading states for better user experience
- Optimized initial page load times (585-626ms initial, 24-42ms subsequent)

**Google Sheets Integration Progress:**
- âœ… OAuth integration and testing infrastructure complete
- âœ… Spreadsheet discovery and data extraction working
- âœ… Provider name auto-extraction from sheet titles
- ðŸ”„ Column mapping templates implementation in progress
- ðŸ”„ Data transformation pipeline development ongoing

**Next Steps:**
1. **Core KPI Visualization:** Implement visualization components for essential dashboard metrics
2. **Google Sheets Data Pipeline:** Complete the data transformation and mapping system
3. **User Management Enhancement:** Implement user invitation and role management features
4. **Goal Tracking Integration:** Connect goal tracking with dashboard visualizations
5. **Testing & Optimization:** End-to-end testing of all dashboard components

## Recent Changes
