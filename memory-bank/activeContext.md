## Active Context (RIPER Workflow)

**Current Mode:** EXECUTE
**Current Focus:** Implementing the dashboard layout and navigation structure (Task 7).
**Key Objectives:** Creating a responsive dashboard layout with proper navigation that aligns with dental practice KPI requirements.

**Relevant Files & Rules:**
