# Task ID: 4
# Title: Develop Google Sheets Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the Google Sheets API integration for connecting to and extracting data from dental practice spreadsheets.
# Details:
Register application in Google Cloud Console and enable necessary APIs. Create OAuth credentials for Google Sheets API. Implement secure token storage and refresh mechanism. Create services for spreadsheet discovery and selection in src/services/google/. Develop API endpoints for Google Sheets operations in src/app/api/google/. Build UI components for connecting to Google Sheets in src/components/google/. Implement error handling for API failures.

# Test Strategy:
Test OAuth flow with Google. Verify spreadsheet discovery and selection works. Test API endpoints with mock spreadsheet data. Verify error handling for various failure scenarios. Test token refresh mechanism.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up Google Cloud Project and OAuth Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Register the application in Google Cloud Console, enable the Google Sheets API, and create OAuth credentials for authentication.
### Details:
1. Create a new project in Google Cloud Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Enable the Google Sheets API for the project
3. Configure the OAuth consent screen with app name and developer contact information
4. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (client ID and client secret) with appropriate redirect URIs
5. Store credentials securely in environment variables or a secure configuration file
6. Create a basic authentication utility in src/services/google/auth.js that loads these credentials
7. Test the configuration by verifying credentials load correctly
8. Document the setup process for other developers

## 2. Implement Google Sheets Authentication and Token Management [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create authentication flow for Google Sheets API access and implement secure token storage and refresh mechanism.
### Details:
1. Create src/services/google/auth.js to handle OAuth flow
2. Implement functions to generate authorization URL for user consent
3. Create callback handler to process OAuth response and obtain access tokens
4. Implement secure token storage mechanism (database or encrypted storage)
5. Build token refresh logic to handle expired tokens automatically
6. Create middleware to verify authentication status before API calls
7. Implement logout/disconnect functionality
8. Add API endpoints in src/app/api/google/auth/route.js for login, callback, and logout
9. Test the complete authentication flow including token refresh
10. Add error handling for authentication failures

## 3. Develop Spreadsheet Discovery and Data Extraction Services [done]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Create services for discovering, selecting, and extracting data from Google Sheets, along with corresponding API endpoints and UI components.
### Details:
1. Create src/services/google/sheets.js with functions to:
   - List available spreadsheets
   - Get spreadsheet metadata (sheets, columns)
   - Read data from specific sheets and ranges
2. Implement API endpoints in src/app/api/google/sheets/route.js for these operations
3. Build UI components in src/components/google/:
   - SpreadsheetSelector.jsx for browsing and selecting spreadsheets
   - SheetConnector.jsx for the connection workflow
   - DataPreview.jsx for displaying extracted data
4. Add error handling for API failures with appropriate user feedback
5. Implement data validation to ensure extracted data meets expected format
6. Add caching mechanism for frequently accessed spreadsheet data
7. Test with various spreadsheet formats and sizes
8. Document the API endpoints and component usage
