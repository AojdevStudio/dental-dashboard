Create KPI calculation services in src/services/KPIs/ for different metric categories (financial, patient, appointment, provider, treatment). Implement business rules for metric calculations. Develop aggregation logic for different time periods. Create goal tracking and variance reporting functionality. Implement trend analysis with historical comparisons. Build API endpoints for retrieving calculated KPIs in src/app/api/KPIs/. Optimize performance for complex calculations.
