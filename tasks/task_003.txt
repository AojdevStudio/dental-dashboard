# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up authentication using Supabase Auth with support for Google OAuth for the Google Sheets API integration.
# Details:
Configure Supabase Auth in the project. Create authentication components in src/components/auth/. Implement sign-in, sign-up, and sign-out functionality. Set up Google OAuth provider for Google Sheets API access. Create authentication hooks in src/hooks/useAuth.ts. Implement protected routes for dashboard pages. Set up middleware for session management in middleware.ts. Create user profile management functionality.

# Test Strategy:
Test user registration and login flows. Verify Google OAuth connection works correctly. Test protected routes to ensure they require authentication. Verify session persistence works as expected. Test user role-based access control.
