# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Data Synchronization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the automated data synchronization system with configurable frequency and support for historical data import.
# Details:
Create a synchronization service in src/services/google/ for fetching data from Google Sheets. Implement incremental update logic to avoid duplicating data. Build scheduling mechanism for automated synchronization with configurable frequency. Develop historical data import functionality. Create UI for managing synchronization settings in src/components/settings/. Implement logging and error handling for synchronization processes. Add notifications for successful/failed synchronizations.

# Test Strategy:
Test synchronization with various spreadsheet formats. Verify incremental updates work correctly. Test historical data import with large datasets. Verify scheduling works at different frequencies. Test error recovery mechanisms. Validate data integrity after synchronization.
