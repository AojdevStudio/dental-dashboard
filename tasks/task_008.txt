# Details:
Create reusable chart components in src/components/charts/ using Recharts. Implement different chart types as specified in the PRD (line charts, bar charts, pie charts, gauge charts, etc.). Build KPI-specific visualization components in src/components/metrics/. Implement interactive features like tooltips, zooming, and drill-down. Create responsive charts that adapt to different screen sizes. Develop goal visualization with target lines/values. Implement chart export functionality for PDF/CSV.

# Test Strategy:
Test each chart type with sample data. Verify interactive features work as expected. Test responsiveness on different screen sizes. Verify goal visualization works correctly. Test export functionality for different formats. Validate chart appearance against design specifications.
