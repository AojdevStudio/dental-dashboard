# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Infrastructure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the Next.js project with TypeScript, configure pnpm workspaces, and set up the recommended technology stack including Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, and Prisma.
# Details:
Create a new Next.js project with TypeScript using `pnpm create next-app`. Configure pnpm workspaces in pnpm-workspace.yaml. Set up Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui following their documentation. Initialize Prisma with `pnpm add prisma @prisma/client` and `npx prisma init`. Configure ESLint and Prettier. Set up the project structure according to the recommended architecture with proper separation of concerns. Create the basic folder structure for components, lib, services, utils, and other directories.

# Test Strategy:
Verify project builds successfully with `pnpm build`. Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed. Test that the development server runs without errors using `pnpm dev`. Validate the project structure against the recommended architecture.
