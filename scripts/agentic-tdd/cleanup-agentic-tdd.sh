## TDD Workflow Summary
This feature was implemented using a comprehensive 3-wave TDD approach with MCP enhancement:

### Wave 1: Task Planning ‚úÖ
- Feature decomposed into atomic, testable tasks
- Dependencies mapped and execution order established  
- Comprehensive acceptance criteria defined
- PRD analysis completed with structured task breakdown

### Wave 2: Test Writing ‚úÖ
- Complete test suite generated for all acceptance criteria
- RED phase verified (all tests initially failing)
- Test framework properly configured and documented
- Edge cases and integration scenarios covered

### Wave 3: Code Writing ‚úÖ
- Systematic implementation following TDD principles
- GREEN phase achieved (all tests now passing)
- Code quality validated with available tools
- Implementation meets all acceptance criteria

## Final Implementation Status
- **All Tests Passing**: $final_test_status
- **TDD Cycle**: Complete (RED ‚Üí GREEN ‚Üí REFACTOR)
- **Quality Gates**: Passed
- **Code Coverage**: 100% of acceptance criteria
- **Documentation**: Complete with artifacts preserved

## MCP Enhancement Results
The implementation leveraged Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools where available:
- **context7**: For current framework patterns and best practices
- **zen!codereview**: For comprehensive quality analysis and validation
- **Hybrid Script + AI**: Efficient workflow with automated setup/teardown

## Archive Information
- **Archive Location**: shared/archives/tdd-${FEATURE_NAME}-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
- **Artifacts Preserved**: Task files, reports, coordination data
- **Implementation History**: Complete workflow documentation
- **Quality Reports**: Final TDD report with metrics and analysis

## Branch Information
- **Feature Branch**: $FEATURE_BRANCH
- **Implementation**: Ready for code review and merge to $MAIN_BRANCH
- **Commit Message**: Comprehensive TDD workflow documentation included
- **Next Steps**: Code review, integration testing, deployment

## Key Deliverables
1. **Production Code**: Complete implementation passing all tests
2. **Test Suite**: Comprehensive coverage of all acceptance criteria  
3. **Documentation**: Task breakdown, implementation plan, final report
4. **Quality Assurance**: Code review, linting, type checking completed
5. **Archive**: Complete workflow history preserved for reference

---

## Next Steps for Team
1. **Code Review**: Review the implementation for team standards
2. **Integration Testing**: Test with existing system components
3. **Merge to Main**: Merge $FEATURE_BRANCH ‚Üí $MAIN_BRANCH after approval
4. **Deployment**: Deploy to staging/production environments
5. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring for the new feature

**Status**: üéâ **READY FOR REVIEW AND DEPLOYMENT**
