# Date and Time Handling Guidelines

## Core Requirement

**ALWAYS run `date` command before writing any dates or times in documents, PRDs, or code.**

## When to Use This Rule

This rule applies when:
- Writing Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)
- Creating technical documentation with dates
- Setting due dates or timelines
- Adding timestamps to any files
- Referencing current dates in code or documentation
- Creating migration files or versioned content

## Mandatory Process

### Step 1: Get Current Date
```bash
date
```

### Step 2: Use Actual Date Information
- **Never assume or guess dates**
- **Always use the output from the `date` command**
- **Format dates consistently across documents**

### Step 3: Calculate Due Dates Accurately
Based on the actual current date from the `date` command:
- Critical priority: +1 day
- High priority: +2-3 days  
- Medium priority: +1 week
- Low priority: +2-3 weeks

## Common Date Formats

### For PRDs and Documentation
- **Created Date**: Use format "June 17, 2025" (Month Day, Year)
- **Due Date**: Use format "June 22, 2025" with calculation explanation
- **Timestamps**: Use ISO format when needed: "2025-06-17T16:40:53"

### For Code and Technical Files
- **Migration files**: Use format "20250617164053" (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS)
- **Version tags**: Use format "v2025.06.17" or semantic versioning
- **Log timestamps**: Use ISO 8601 format

## Examples

### ✅ Correct Process
```bash
# First, get current date
$ date
Tue Jun 17 16:40:53 CDT 2025

# Then use actual date in PRD
- **Created:** June 17, 2025
- **Due Date:** June 22, 2025 (5 days from start)
```

### ❌ Incorrect Process
```markdown
# Don't do this - using assumed/wrong dates
- **Created:** January 17, 2025  # Wrong month!
- **Due Date:** January 22, 2025  # Calculated from wrong date!
```

## Integration with PRD Templates

When using PRD templates like [senior-technical-pm.xml](mdc:prompt-library/senior-technical-pm.xml):

1. **Always run `date` first**
2. **Replace template date placeholders with actual dates**
3. **Calculate due dates from the real current date**
4. **Double-check all date references for accuracy**

## Quality Assurance

Before submitting any document with dates:
- [ ] Ran `date` command to get current date
- [ ] All dates reflect actual current date
- [ ] Due dates calculated correctly from current date
- [ ] Date formats are consistent throughout document
- [ ] No placeholder or template dates remain

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Using template dates without updating them**
2. **Assuming the current date without checking**
3. **Inconsistent date formats within the same document**
4. **Calculating due dates from wrong starting date**
5. **Using different time zones without clarification**

**Remember: When in doubt about dates, run `date` again!**
