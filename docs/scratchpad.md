# Authentication Pages Implementation Plan

## Overview

We need to implement two missing authentication features for our dental dashboard:
1. User registration (signup) page
2. Password reset functionality

## Current State

- Login page exists at `src/app/auth/login/page.tsx` with the `SignIn1` component
- Supabase auth is implemented correctly using `@supabase/ssr`
- Middleware is in place to handle authentication
- The login component has a link to `/auth/signup`

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Create Signup Page

**File Structure:**
- [x] `src/app/auth/signup/page.tsx` - Main signup page
- [x] `src/app/auth/signup/loading.tsx` - Loading state (mirror login page structure)
- [x] `src/app/auth/signup/error.tsx` - Error handling (mirror login page structure)
- [x] `src/components/ui/modern-stunning-sign-up.tsx` - Signup form component

**Component Features:**
- [x] Email/password registration form
- [x] Google OAuth signup option
- [x] Form validation
- [x] Success/error state handling
- [x] Link back to login page
- [x] Matching visual style with login page

### 2. Create Password Reset Flow ✅

**File Structure:**
- [x] `src/app/auth/reset-password/page.tsx` - Request password reset page
- [x] `src/app/auth/reset-password/loading.tsx` - Loading state
- [x] `src/app/auth/reset-password/error.tsx` - Error handling
- [x] `src/app/auth/reset-password/confirm/page.tsx` - Handle reset token & new password creation
- [x] `src/components/ui/password-reset-request.tsx` - Request form component
- [x] `src/components/ui/password-reset-confirm.tsx` - Password reset confirmation component

**Password Request Features:**
- [x] Email input field
- [x] Validation
- [x] Success message with instructions
- [x] Link back to login

**Password Reset Confirmation Features:**
- [x] New password & confirmation fields
- [x] Validation 
- [x] Automatic token extraction from URL
- [x] Success/error messages
- [x] Redirect to login after success

### 3. Update Login Page Component ✅

**Changes:**
- [x] Add "Forgot password?" link to the login form
- [x] Point link to `/auth/reset-password`

### 4. Create Authentication Actions

- [ ] Create reusable server actions for auth operations (optional for improved architecture)
- [ ] `src/actions/auth/signup.ts`
- [ ] `src/actions/auth/reset-password.ts`

### 5. Update Navigation Flow

- [ ] Ensure proper redirection from auth pages to dashboard when already logged in
- [ ] Add protective checks to prevent access to password reset confirmation page without token

## Implementation Details

**Signup Form Details:**
- [x] Email and password inputs with validation
- [x] Google OAuth option
- [x] Terms acceptance checkbox
- [x] Form submission with loading state
- [x] Error handling for existing accounts

**Password Reset Request Details:**
- [x] Email input with validation
- [x] Success screen with check email message
- [x] Error handling for non-existent accounts

**Password Reset Confirmation Details:**
- [x] New password with confirmation
- [x] Password strength requirements
- [x] Token validation
- [x] Success screen with auto-redirect

## Testing Plan

1. Test signup with valid and invalid credentials
2. Test password reset request flow
3. Test password reset completion flow
4. Test redirects for authenticated users
5. Test OAuth authentication flow

## Next Steps After Planning

1. Create signup page component
2. Create password reset request component
3. Create password reset confirmation component
4. Update login page with forgot password link
5. Test the complete authentication flow


## Issue 1: After signup, the user is not redirected to the dashboard - not created but lets use a placeholder. Result right now is a 404 error.
## Issue 2: Using email/password, the user doesn't get a verification email yet. 

## Google OAuth Credentials Utility

The authentication utility includes:
    - Loading of Google OAuth credentials from environment variables
    - Functions for the complete OAuth flow:
        - getAuthorizationUrl() - Generates the Google authorization URL
        - exchangeCodeForTokens() - Exchanges authorization code for tokens
        - refreshAccessToken() - Refreshes access tokens using refresh tokens
        - getUserProfile() - Fetches user profile information
        - revokeToken() - Revokes tokens when needed
        - validateConfig() - Validates that credentials are properly configured
    - The utility is designed to work with the Google OAuth credentials you provided in your .env file and follows modern JavaScript practices with proper error handling and documentation.

### POSTgREST Issues Troubleshooting

    - I ran this query:
    ```sql
    SELECT setrole::regrole, setconfig
    FROM pg_db_role_setting
    WHERE setrole::regrole = 'authenticator'::regrole;
```
    - I got this response:
    ["session_preload_libraries=safeupdate","statement_timeout=8s","lock_timeout=8s"]

I want to immediately restore API access to the specified schemas and updates to the database. But unsure if i should do this by running the following query:

```sql
ALTER ROLE authenticator SET pgrst.db_schemas = 'public, storage';
NOTIFY pgrst;
```

Here are some additional debugging steps I can take:
4. Check Schema and Table Privileges

Ensure the relevant roles (anon, authenticated, service_role) have the necessary privileges on the schema and its tables.

For custom schemas, grant usage and table access:

sql
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA myschema TO anon, authenticated, service_role;
GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA myschema TO anon, authenticated, service_role;
Adjust privileges as needed for your security model.

5. Row Level Security (RLS)

Supabase requires RLS to be enabled for any table exposed via the Data API.

If you created tables outside the dashboard, manually enable RLS.

6. Reload or Notify PostgREST

After making changes to roles or schema exposure, use NOTIFY pgrst; to reload PostgREST's configuration immediately.

7. Additional Debugging Tools

Use the Supabase CLI's inspect db commands to check for database issues, bloat, or privilege problems.

Review API documentation and error messages for clues (e.g., "The schema must be one of the following: storage" indicates a misconfiguration in exposed schemas or the authenticator role).

To verify if your PostgREST schema exposure is enabled correctly in Supabase, follow these steps:

1. Check Exposed Schemas in Supabase Dashboard

Go to your Supabase project dashboard.

Navigate to API Settings.

Under "Exposed schemas", ensure your desired schemas (e.g., public, storage, or any custom schema) are listed. This allows those schemas to be available via the API.

2. Verify Database Role Configuration

Sometimes, even if the dashboard lists your schema as exposed, the underlying PostgreSQL role (authenticator) may not be configured correctly.

Run the following SQL query in the SQL editor to check the current setting:

sql
SELECT setrole::regrole, setconfig
FROM pg_db_role_setting
WHERE setrole::regrole = 'authenticator'::regrole;
Look for the pgrst.db_schemas setting. It should include all schemas you want exposed (e.g., public, storage). If your intended schema is missing, that's the issue.

3. Fix Schema Exposure (if needed)

If the schema is missing from pgrst.db_schemas, update it with:

sql
ALTER ROLE authenticator SET pgrst.db_schemas = 'public, storage';
NOTIFY pgrst;
Replace 'public, storage' with your actual schema list as needed. This change takes effect immediately and restores schema visibility in the API and docs.

4. Confirm Privileges and RLS

Make sure the correct roles (anon, authenticated, service_role) have usage and access privileges on the schema and its tables.

For every table you want exposed, ensure Row Level Security (RLS) is enabled and that appropriate policies exist.

5. Test API Access

Use the Supabase client with the correct schema specified:

js
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'
const supabase = createClient(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, { db: { schema: 'myschema' } })
const { data, error } = await supabase.from('your_table').select('*')
Alternatively, use curl or Postman to request data from your API endpoint and verify you receive the expected results.

6. Check API Documentation

Visit your project's auto-generated API docs in the Supabase dashboard.

Your exposed schemas and their tables should appear. If not, double-check the steps above.

Summary Table

Step	What to Check/Do
Dashboard Settings	Schema listed under "Exposed schemas"
Role Configuration	authenticator role's pgrst.db_schemas includes your schema
Privileges & RLS	Roles have usage/access, RLS enabled with policies
API Test	Data accessible via API (Supabase client, curl, or Postman)
API Docs	Schema and tables visible in auto-generated docs
By following these steps, you can confidently verify and, if necessary, correct your PostgREST schema exposure in Supabase.
