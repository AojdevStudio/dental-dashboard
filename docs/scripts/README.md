# Scripts Documentation

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the Dental Dashboard project's script system, which has been reorganized for improved maintainability and clarity.

## Overview

The scripts directory has been transformed from a cluttered 50+ file structure into an organized, categorized system with clear responsibilities and documentation.

## Script Naming Conventions

All scripts follow **kebab-case** naming conventions as per project standards:
- ‚úÖ `migrate-to-uuid.ts`
- ‚úÖ `test-sync-resilience.ts`
- ‚úÖ `debug-provider-detection.cjs`
- ‚ùå `MigrateToUuid.ts` (PascalCase)
- ‚ùå `test_sync_resilience.ts` (snake_case)

## Environment Safety

### Database Environment Protection
Scripts include comprehensive environment validation to prevent accidental operations on production:

```typescript
import { validateTestEnvironment } from '@/lib/utils/test-environment-guard';
validateTestEnvironment(); // Throws if production detected
```

### Cloud Testing Infrastructure
- All tests use cloud Supabase branch database (`.env.test`)
- No local database dependencies in CI/CD
- Isolated testing environment prevents production contamination

## Usage Patterns

### Database Operations
```bash
# Migration workflow
pnpm migrate:uuid           # Execute migration
pnpm migrate:validate       # Validate results
# If issues found:
pnpm migrate:rollback       # Safe rollback

# Post-seeding workflow
pnpm prisma:seed           # Seed database
pnpm sync:post-reseed      # Sync external systems
```

### Testing Workflow
```bash
# Local development testing
pnpm test                  # Run full test suite
pnpm test:watch           # Development mode

# Integration testing
pnpm test:gas             # Test GAS integration
pnpm test:integration     # Run integration tests

# Performance validation
tsx scripts/testing/performance/compare-db-performance.ts
```

### Deployment Workflow
```bash
# Google Apps Script deployment
pnpm gas:deploy           # Deploy all GAS applications
pnpm gas:health           # Verify deployment health

# Selective deployment
pnpm gas:deploy:dentist   # Deploy dentist sync only
pnpm gas:deploy:hygienist # Deploy hygienist sync only
```

### Debugging Workflow
```bash
# Code quality analysis
pnpm null-safety:report   # Check null safety violations
pnpm security:scan        # Security vulnerability scan

# Data integrity analysis
tsx scripts/debugging/debug-provider-relationships.ts
tsx scripts/debugging/scan-contamination.js
```

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Package.json Integration
All scripts are integrated with the package.json scripts section for easy access:
- Testing scripts ‚Üí `pnpm test*` commands
- Database operations ‚Üí `pnpm migrate*` and `pnpm sync*` commands
- Deployment ‚Üí `pnpm gas*` commands
- Code quality ‚Üí `pnpm null-safety*` and `pnpm security*` commands

### IDE Integration
- Scripts are organized in logical directories for easy IDE navigation
- README files in each directory provide context and usage instructions
- Consistent naming makes script discovery intuitive

### CI/CD Integration
- Scripts support automated execution in GitHub Actions
- Cloud database testing ensures consistent CI/CD environment
- Environment validation prevents accidental production operations

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Adding New Scripts
1. **Choose the correct directory** based on script purpose
2. **Follow kebab-case naming** conventions
3. **Include environment validation** for safety
4. **Add package.json entry** if commonly used
5. **Update relevant README** files
6. **Include TSDoc comments** for exported functions

### Modifying Existing Scripts
1. **Maintain backward compatibility** where possible
2. **Update package.json paths** if files are moved
3. **Update documentation** to reflect changes
4. **Test changes** in development environment first

### Directory Organization Principles
- **Purpose-based grouping** - scripts grouped by primary function
- **Clear separation** - testing vs. production operations
- **Environment safety** - development vs. production script separation
- **Consistent documentation** - README in every directory

## Migration from Old Structure

The reorganization transformed:
- **50+ files** in scripts root ‚Üí **6 organized directories**
- **Mixed naming conventions** ‚Üí **Consistent kebab-case**
- **No documentation** ‚Üí **Comprehensive README files**
- **Ad-hoc organization** ‚Üí **Logical categorical structure**

### Benefits Achieved
- ‚úÖ **Improved discoverability** - logical organization makes finding scripts intuitive
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced maintainability** - clear separation of concerns and documentation
- ‚úÖ **Better developer experience** - README files provide context and usage
- ‚úÖ **Reduced cognitive load** - organized structure reduces mental overhead
- ‚úÖ **Consistent naming** - kebab-case throughout improves predictability
- ‚úÖ **Scalable structure** - easy to add new scripts in appropriate categories

This reorganization transforms the scripts directory from cluttered and confusing to organized and maintainable, supporting the project's long-term development needs.
