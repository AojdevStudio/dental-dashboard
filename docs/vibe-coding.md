## ‚ú® Executive Summary

- Vibe Coding is a conversational, intuitive style of AI development where the keyboard becomes secondary to high-level prompts and AI reasoning.
- Leveraging tools like Super Whisper, ChatGPT, and enhanced prompt templates can dramatically increase development speed and code quality.
- Building with an AI-optimized stack such as TypeScript, Next.js, and Tailwind significantly improves AI‚Äôs effectiveness.
- Creating rubrics, structured PRDs/BRDs, and markdown checklists elevates the quality and clarity of AI outputs.
- Debugging and UI iteration should focus on prompting reasoning models instead of rushing to fixes or visual tweaks.

## üé• Introduction to Vibe Coding

> _"You just talk to Composer with Super Whisper. You barely touch the keyboard. You ask for dumb things and it just works."_
> ‚Äî **Andrej Karpathy**, as shared by Kevin

Vibe Coding refers to a new paradigm in software development that integrates natural language prompts, intelligent assistants, and pre-optimized stacks. It promotes intuition-led, speech-to-code workflows that minimize boilerplate and accelerate high-level system design.

### üß† Tip 1: Use an AI-Friendly Stack

> _"Oftentimes the biggest reason why people fail with AI tools is that they're just not using the right technologies."_

üü¶ **Recommended Stack Components:**

| Tool/Library     | Purpose                              | Reason for Use                                           |
|------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Next.js (App Router) | Frontend framework                  | File-based, type-safe, familiar to most AI models         |
| TypeScript       | Language                             | Enables type-safe prompts and strong linting feedback     |
| TRPC             | API Layer                            | Leverages Zod schemas for type safety                     |
| Prisma           | ORM                                  | Intuitive and widely supported by AI                      |
| Supabase Auth    | Authentication                       | Pre-built, reduces complexity for AI                      |
| Supabase         | Database                             | Hosted Postgres, easy to use                              |
| Tailwind CSS     | Styling                              | Inline styles understandable by AI                        |
| Framer Motion    | Animation                            | Adds interactive polish                                   |
| Resend           | Email                                | Easy integration                                          |
| AWS S3           | Storage                              | Cheap, portable, and reliable                            |

üü® **Example**: Using Tailwind allows AI to generate class-based styling without needing external files.

### üßæ Tip 3: Use an Agent Task `.md` File

> _"Create a detailed markdown checklist of one story-point tasks."_

üìò Example Format:
```markdown
- [ ] Create login form component
- [ ] Integrate API call using TRPC
- [ ] Write validation logic with Zod
