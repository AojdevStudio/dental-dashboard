# BMAD Story: AOJ-71 - RLS Timing Optimization

## Story Overview

**Linear Issue**: AOJ-71 - RLS Timing Optimization  
**BMAD Priority**: High (Performance & Security)  
**Estimated Timeline**: 2-3 Days  
**Agent Assignment**: Dev Agent with QA Agent + Performance Specialist  
**Story Type**: Performance Optimization & Security Enhancement  

---

## Background Context

Following the successful implementation of PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) in AOJ-65, performance monitoring has identified timing-related issues with RLS policy enforcement. The current implementation, while secure, may have performance bottlenecks in high-concurrency scenarios and during context switching operations.

**Current Performance Challenges**:
- RLS policy evaluation adding latency to database queries
- Context switching overhead in multi-tenant operations  
- Potential N+1 query problems with RLS-enabled tables
- Connection pooling complications with session-based context

**Technical Debt from AOJ-65**:
- Context setting requires database round-trip for each operation
- RLS policies may not be optimally indexed
- Query performance degradation observed in some scenarios
- Connection reuse patterns need optimization

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Optimization Strategy

```sql
-- Index optimization for RLS performance
-- Covering indexes for common provider queries
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_providers_clinic_performance 
ON providers (clinic_id, provider_type, status) 
INCLUDE (id, name, created_at);

-- Composite index for provider performance queries
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_dentist_production_clinic_date_range
ON dentist_production (clinic_id, provider_id, production_date)
WHERE production_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 year';

-- Partial index for active records only  
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_provider_locations_active
ON provider_locations (clinic_id, provider_id, location_id)
WHERE is_active = true AND end_date IS NULL;
```

### Application-Level Optimizations

```typescript
// Enhanced RLS context management
export class EnhancedRLSManager {
  private static instance: EnhancedRLSManager;
  private contextCache = new LRUCache<string, string>({ max: 1000, ttl: 300000 });
  
  // Optimized context setting with caching
  async setClinicContext(clinicId: string): Promise<void> {
    const cacheKey = `context:${clinicId}`;
    
    if (this.contextCache.has(cacheKey)) {
      return; // Context already set
    }
    
    await prisma.$executeRaw`SELECT auth.set_clinic_context(${clinicId}::uuid)`;
    this.contextCache.set(cacheKey, clinicId);
  }
  
  // Batch operations with single context
  async withBatchOperations<T>(
    clinicId: string,
    operations: (() => Promise<T>)[]
  ): Promise<T[]> {
    await this.setClinicContext(clinicId);
    
    try {
      // Execute all operations with single context setting
      return await Promise.all(operations.map(op => op()));
    } finally {
      await this.clearContext();
    }
  }
}
```

### Query Optimization Patterns

```typescript
// Optimized provider performance query
export async function getProviderPerformanceOptimized(
  params: ProviderPerformanceParams
): Promise<ProviderPerformanceMetrics[]> {
  // Use optimized query with proper indexing
  const query = `
    SELECT 
      p.id as provider_id,
      p.name as provider_name,
      l.id as location_id,
      l.name as location_name,
      -- Use window functions for better performance
      SUM(dp.production_amount) OVER (
        PARTITION BY p.id, l.id 
        ORDER BY dp.production_date
        RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL '30 days' PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
      ) as rolling_30_day_production
    FROM providers p
    INNER JOIN provider_locations pl ON p.id = pl.provider_id
    INNER JOIN locations l ON pl.location_id = l.id  
    LEFT JOIN dentist_production dp ON p.id = dp.provider_id
    WHERE p.clinic_id = auth.get_current_clinic_id()
      AND dp.production_date >= $1
      AND dp.production_date <= $2
    ORDER BY p.name, l.name;
  `;
  
  return await prisma.$queryRaw(query, params.startDate, params.endDate);
}
```

## Performance Targets & Validation

### Performance Improvement Goals
- **Query Response Time**: 30% improvement on provider dashboard queries
- **Context Switching**: 50% reduction in context setting overhead  
- **Connection Pool**: 20% improvement in connection utilization
- **Overall Application**: <10% total performance degradation from pre-RLS baseline

### Performance Testing Strategy
```typescript
// Performance validation test suite
describe('RLS Performance Optimization', () => {
  it('should maintain query performance within acceptable limits', async () => {
    // Baseline measurement
    const baseline = await measureQueryPerformance(standardProviderQuery);
    
    // Optimized measurement  
    const optimized = await measureQueryPerformance(optimizedProviderQuery);
    
    // Validation
    expect(optimized.averageTime).toBeLessThan(baseline.averageTime * 0.7);
  });
  
  it('should reduce context switching overhead', async () => {
    const contextSwitchTime = await measureContextSwitching(1000);
    expect(contextSwitchTime).toBeLessThan(CONTEXT_SWITCH_BASELINE * 0.5);
  });
});
```

## Security Validation Requirements

### Non-Negotiable Security Constraints
- [ ] **Zero Security Regression**: All RLS policies must remain fully enforced
- [ ] **Cross-Tenant Isolation**: No performance optimization can compromise data isolation
- [ ] **Context Integrity**: Clinic context must remain secure throughout optimizations
- [ ] **Audit Compliance**: All security controls must remain auditable

### Security Testing During Optimization
```typescript
// Security regression testing
describe('RLS Security Validation', () => {
  it('should maintain complete tenant isolation after optimization', async () => {
    await withClinicContext('clinic-1', async () => {
      const providers = await getProviders();
      expect(providers.every(p => p.clinicId === 'clinic-1')).toBe(true);
    });
  });
  
  it('should prevent cross-tenant data access in optimized queries', async () => {
    // Comprehensive tenant isolation testing
  });
});
```

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Performance Optimization Risks
- **Security Regression**: Comprehensive security testing throughout optimization
