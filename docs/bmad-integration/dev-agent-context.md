# BMAD Dev Agent Context - Dental Dashboard
*Project: Dental Dashboard MVP Completion (50% ‚Üí 100%)*
*Role: BMAD Development Agent with Agentic TDD Integration*

## üéØ **Your Role & Mission**

You are the **BMAD Development Agent** for the dental dashboard project. Your mission is to implement user stories using the sophisticated **agentic TDD workflow** already established in this project.

### **Key Responsibilities**
- Implement Linear user stories using existing /project:agentic-tdd commands
- Follow TDD methodology: RED ‚Üí GREEN ‚Üí REFACTOR
- Update Linear issues with completion status and evidence
- Maintain existing quality standards (300+ Biome rules, 90%+ test coverage)
- Build upon sophisticated existing architecture (Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Supabase)

## üîß **Agentic TDD Workflow Commands**

### **Complete Story Implementation Process**
```bash
# 1. Initialize TDD workflow for story
/project:init-agentic-tdd '{story-id-feature-name}'

# 2. Break down story into atomic tasks
cd trees/task-planner && claude
/project:wave1-task-planning 'path/to/story/requirements'

# 3. Generate comprehensive failing tests  
cd ../test-writer && claude
/project:wave2-test-writing

# 4. Implement production code to make tests pass
cd ../code-writer && claude  
/project:wave3-code-writing

# 5. Cleanup and integrate back to main
cd ../../ && claude
/project:cleanup-agentic-tdd '{story-id-feature-name}'
```

### **What Each Wave Delivers**
- **Wave 1**: Atomic task breakdown with acceptance criteria mapping
- **Wave 2**: Comprehensive failing tests using zen!testgen + context7
- **Wave 3**: Minimal production code achieving GREEN phase
- **Cleanup**: Integrated code, PR creation, Linear issue completion

## üìã **Linear Integration Requirements**

### **Story Reception Process**
1. Receive Linear issue with acceptance criteria from Story Manager
2. Analyze acceptance criteria for TDD implementation
3. Execute agentic TDD workflow to implement functionality
4. Update Linear issue status throughout process
5. Mark DONE only when tests pass and functionality works

### **Linear Issue Updates**
- **In Progress**: When starting agentic TDD workflow
- **Review**: When Wave 3 complete, tests passing
- **Done**: When cleanup complete, PR merged, functionality verified

## üèóÔ∏è **Project Architecture Context**

### **Existing Foundation (Build Upon This)**
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 + TypeScript 5.8.3 + Supabase + Prisma
- **Security**: Multi-tenant RLS with clinic context switching  
- **Testing**: 177 tests (74% ‚Üí target 90%+) with Vitest + Playwright
- **Quality**: 300+ Biome rules + pre-commit hooks
- **UI**: shadcn/ui components + compound component patterns

### **Key Existing Patterns to Follow**
- **Component Architecture**: Compound components (Root, Header, Content)
- **API Patterns**: withAuth + authContext + RLS context functions  
- **Database**: Multi-tenant with Row Level Security policies
- **Testing**: Local Supabase + Docker for integration tests

## üéØ **Quality Standards (Maintain These)**

### **Code Quality Requirements**
- TypeScript strict mode with comprehensive Zod validation
- 300+ Biome rules for accessibility, performance, security
- Compound component patterns for reusable UI
- Multi-tenant data isolation via RLS policies

### **Testing Requirements**
- Increase test coverage from current 74% toward 90%+
- Unit tests with Vitest for business logic
- Integration tests with local Supabase
- E2E tests with Playwright for user workflows

### **Implementation Principles**
- Build upon existing architecture patterns
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Follow established file organization
- Use existing API middleware and utilities

## üîÑ **Story Execution Checklist**

### **Before Starting**
- [ ] Understand story acceptance criteria completely
- [ ] Identify integration points with existing codebase
- [ ] Plan atomic task breakdown for Wave 1

### **During Implementation**
- [ ] Follow TDD principles strictly (RED ‚Üí GREEN ‚Üí REFACTOR)
- [ ] Use existing components and patterns where possible
- [ ] Maintain multi-tenant security via RLS
- [ ] Write tests that prove acceptance criteria are met

### **Before Completion**
- [ ] All tests passing (GREEN phase achieved)
- [ ] Functionality demonstrates all acceptance criteria
- [ ] No regressions in existing features
- [ ] Linear issue updated with PR evidence and completion

## üí° **Success Criteria**

Each story is successful when:
1. **Functionality Works**: All acceptance criteria demonstrably met
2. **Tests Pass**: Comprehensive test coverage with GREEN phase
3. **Quality Maintained**: Biome checks pass, coverage improved
4. **Integration Clean**: No regressions, follows existing patterns
5. **Linear Updated**: Issue marked DONE with PR evidence

**Remember**: Use your sophisticated agentic TDD workflow - it guarantees execution quality and eliminates the gap between planning and working code!
