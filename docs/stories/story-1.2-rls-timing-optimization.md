# Story 1.2: RLS Policy Timing Optimization

## Status: Approved

## Story
- As a system administrator responsible for healthcare data security
- I want RLS policies to enforce multi-tenant data protection with optimal performance
- so that the application maintains responsive user experience while protecting sensitive dental practice data with zero security compromise

## Background Context
**Linear Issue**: AOJ-71  
**Priority**: High (Critical Security Performance)  
**Current Challenge**: RLS policies from AOJ-65 implementation causing performance bottlenecks  
**Security Constraint**: Zero tolerance for security regression - performance optimization cannot compromise data isolation

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

### AC1: Performance Baseline and Analysis
- [ ] Comprehensive performance baseline captured for all RLS-enabled tables
- [ ] Query execution plan analysis completed for major provider/patient queries using EXPLAIN ANALYZE
- [ ] Context switching overhead measured with specific metrics (<50ms target)
- [ ] Connection pooling impact assessment documented with before/after metrics
- [ ] Performance bottlenecks identified with quantified impact on response times

### AC2: Database Optimization Implementation
- [ ] All `clinic_id` columns properly indexed with covering indexes for RLS performance
- [ ] Composite indexes created for common query patterns (provider performance, date ranges)
- [ ] Index usage validated through query execution plans showing index utilization
- [ ] Database migration scripts created for production deployment
- [ ] Target achieved: 30% improvement in query response times

### AC3: Context Management Optimization
- [ ] Context caching mechanism implemented to reduce database round-trips
- [ ] Connection-level context persistence optimized for session reuse
- [ ] Batch operation context switching minimized with single context setting
- [ ] Session-based context management enhanced with proper cleanup
- [ ] Target achieved: 50% reduction in context switching overhead

### AC4: Security Validation and Monitoring
- [ ] Zero security regression: All RLS policies remain fully enforced
- [ ] Cross-tenant isolation maintained: No performance optimization compromises data isolation
- [ ] Context integrity verified: Clinic context remains secure throughout optimizations
- [ ] Comprehensive security regression testing with multi-tenant validation
- [ ] Performance monitoring dashboard implemented with security metrics

- [ ] Create database migration scripts in `prisma/migrations/` for index deployment
- [ ] Validate index effectiveness with `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` before/after comparisons

## Dev Notes

### Technical Architecture Context
- **Security Foundation**: Built upon AOJ-65 RLS implementation - cannot compromise existing security
- **Performance Target**: <10% total performance degradation from pre-RLS baseline
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM, multi-tenant RLS policies
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive performance and security validation required

### Critical Security Constraints
**ZERO TOLERANCE FOR SECURITY REGRESSION**
- All RLS policies must remain fully enforced throughout optimization
- Cross-tenant data isolation cannot be compromised for performance gains
- Clinic context integrity must be maintained under all optimization scenarios
- Complete auditability of all data access must be preserved

### Performance Optimization Strategy
```typescript
// Enhanced RLS context management with caching
export class EnhancedRLSManager {
  private static instance: EnhancedRLSManager;
  private contextCache = new LRUCache<string, string>({ max: 1000, ttl: 300000 });
  
  async setClinicContextCached(clinicId: string): Promise<void> {
    const cacheKey = `context:${clinicId}`;
    
    if (this.contextCache.has(cacheKey)) {
      return; // Context already set, avoid database call
    }
    
    await prisma.$executeRaw`SELECT auth.set_clinic_context(${clinicId}::uuid)`;
    this.contextCache.set(cacheKey, clinicId);
  }
  
  // Batch operations with single context setting
  async withBatchOperations<T>(
    clinicId: string,
    operations: (() => Promise<T>)[]
  ): Promise<T[]> {
    await this.setClinicContextCached(clinicId);
    
    try {
      return await Promise.all(operations.map(op => op()));
    } finally {
      await this.clearContext();
    }
  }
}
```

### Database Optimization Patterns
```sql
-- Covering indexes for RLS performance
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_providers_clinic_performance 
ON providers (clinic_id, provider_type, status) 
INCLUDE (id, name, created_at);

-- Composite index for provider performance queries
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_dentist_production_clinic_date_range
ON dentist_production (clinic_id, provider_id, production_date)
WHERE production_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 year';

-- Partial index for active records only  
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_provider_locations_active
ON provider_locations (clinic_id, provider_id, location_id)
WHERE is_active = true AND end_date IS NULL;
```

### AI Implementation Guardrails
**CRITICAL**: This story requires careful incremental implementation
- **Security-First Approach**: Validate security at every optimization step
- **Incremental Changes**: One optimization type at a time with full validation
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring during implementation
- **Rollback Capability**: Quick rollback for any optimization causing issues
