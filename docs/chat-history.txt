Review of src/hooks/useFilterStore.ts:
Potential Considerations/Improvements:
getDateRangeForPeriod for 'custom': When setTimePeriod is called with 'custom', or if default case is hit in getDateRangeForPeriod, it defaults to the last 30 days. This is reasonable, but ensure this behavior is intended and documented if setTimePeriod('custom') is ever called directly without an immediate setDateRange. Currently, setDateRange always sets timePeriod: "custom", so setTimePeriod is the main way predefined periods are set.
Serialization of Dates in Persisted State: Zustand's persist middleware will automatically handle Date objects. It typically serializes them to ISO strings and deserializes them back to Date objects. This is generally fine, but it's good to be aware of. If you encounter issues with date types after rehydration, you might need a custom storage option with JSON.parse and JSON.stringify revivers/replacers, but the default usually works.
clearFilters vs. resetToDefaults: Currently, they do the same thing. If clearFilters is intended to set filters to an "empty" or "all" state (e.g., empty date range, all clinics/providers selected or no filters applied), then its logic should differ from resetToDefaults. If they are meant to be identical, then having both is fine for semantic clarity.

Review of src/components/dashboards/filters/MultiSelectCombobox.tsx:
Potential Considerations/Improvements:
ComboboxItem type: This is clear and simple.
Trigger Button Display:
When many items are selected, the div with flex-wrap gap-1 will wrap badges. The max-w-[90%] on this div is to leave space for the ChevronsUpDown icon. This is a common approach. Consider if very long labels within badges could still cause overflow issues or if truncation/tooltips would be needed for extreme cases (though likely fine for typical clinic/provider names).
Performance with Large items List: For very large lists of items (e.g., thousands), rendering all CommandItems might have a performance impact. Command from cmdk (which Shadcn's Command is built upon) is generally quite performant, but if this becomes an issue, virtualization could be explored (though it would add complexity). For typical numbers of clinics/providers, this should be fine.
Popover Width: PopoverContent has w-full. This means it will take the width of its parent. The Button trigger is w-full. If the MultiSelectCombobox is placed in a narrow container, the popover content might also be narrow. align="start" helps. You could also consider PopoverContent props like style={{ width: 'var(--radix-popover-trigger-width)' }} or specific min-width if needed, but w-full is often a good default.
