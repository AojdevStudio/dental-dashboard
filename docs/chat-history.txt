[MODE: EXECUTE]
Ah, I see the confusion. The file you've pointed to, `src/vitest-setup.ts`, is the one we just created. This file *tells* Vitest *what* to set up (in this case, the jest-dom matchers).

We still need to find the main Vitest *configuration* file. This is the file that *tells* Vitest *to use* `src/vitest-setup.ts`.

Common names for this Vitest configuration file are:
*   `vitest.config.ts` (or `.js`, `.mjs`)
*   `vite.config.ts` (or `.js`, `.mjs`) - Vitest can be configured within a Vite config file if you're using Vite as your build tool.

These files are usually located in the root directory of your project, alongside `package.json` and `tsconfig.json`.

Could you please check your project root for a file named like `vitest.config.ts` or `vite.config.ts`?

If you don't have one, Vitest might also be configured directly in your `package.json` file, under a script or a dedicated `vitest` key, though a separate config file is more common for specifying options like `setupFiles`.

Let's try searching for those specific filenames again.

Ran tool
Okay, looking at the root directory listing, I don't see an obvious `vitest.config.ts` or `vite.config.ts`.

However, a Next.js project (`next.config.ts` is present) sometimes integrates Vitest configuration differently.

Let's check `package.json` to see if Vitest is configured or run via a script that might point us to the config.


Read file: package.json
Okay, I've reviewed your `package.json`.
The test scripts are:
*   `"test": "vitest"`
*   `"test:watch": "vitest watch"`
*   `"test:coverage": "vitest run --coverage"`

This confirms you are using Vitest directly. Since there's no explicit configuration file mentioned in the scripts (like `vitest -c vitest.config.ts`), Vitest will look for a default configuration file.

The default configuration files Vitest looks for are (in order of precedence):
1.  `vitest.config.ts`
2.  `vitest.config.js`
3.  `vitest.config.mjs`
4.  `vite.config.ts` (if Vitest is part of a Vite project)
5.  `vite.config.js`
6.  `vite.config.mjs`

Since we didn't find any of these in the root directory, it's possible:
*   You don't have a custom Vitest configuration file, and it's running with defaults.
*   The configuration file is located somewhere non-standard or has a different name, which Vitest isn't picking up by default.

**If you don't have a custom Vitest config file (`vitest.config.ts` or similar), we should create one.** This is the standard way to provide options like `setupFiles`.

Would you like me to create a basic `vitest.config.ts` in your project root and add the necessary `setupFiles` configuration to it? This new file would then be automatically picked up by Vitest when you run `pnpm test`.


Okay, I've created the `vitest.config.ts` file in your project root with the following content:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    globals: true,
    environment: 'jsdom',
    setupFiles: ['./src/vitest-setup.ts'],
  },
});
```

This file configures Vitest to:
*   Use globals (like `vi`, `describe`, `it`, `expect`) so you don't have to import them in every test file.
*   Use the `jsdom` environment to simulate a browser environment for your tests.
*   Run the `src/vitest-setup.ts` file before your tests, which will make the Jest DOM matchers (like `.toBeInTheDocument()`) available.

**With these changes:**
1.  `@testing-library/jest-dom` is installed.
2.  `src/vitest-setup.ts` is created and imports the matchers.
3.  `vitest.config.ts` is created and tells Vitest to use the setup file and other common defaults.
4.  `tsconfig.json` is updated to help TypeScript recognize the types.

Now, the linter errors in `src/components/google/__tests__/SpreadsheetSelector.test.tsx` should be resolved. You might need to restart your editor or TypeScript language server for all changes to be recognized.

Please check if the linter errors are gone from that test file. If they are, we can consider this setup complete and move on.
