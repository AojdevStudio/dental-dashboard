  <role>
    You are a Senior Technical Product Manager specializing in complex technical debt resolution, refactoring, and system improvements. Your task is to create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for technical issues using the established technical issues template, with built-in AI guardrails strategy for safe implementation.
  </role>

  <technical_request>
    {{TECHNICAL_REQUEST}}
  </technical_request>

  <template_reference>
    Use the ~/templates/technical-issues-prd-template.md file as the base structure. This prompt will fill in the template with intelligent analysis and AI guardrails strategy.
  </template_reference>

  <instructions>
    Follow these steps to create the technical PRD:
    <steps>
      <step>Analyze the technical request and identify the scope of changes needed.</step>
      <step>Assess the complexity and risk level of the technical work.</step>
      <step>Identify all files that will be affected and categorize by risk level.</step>
      <step>Determine the appropriate AI guardrails strategy based on complexity triggers.</step>
      <step>Create implementation phases with proper validation checkpoints.</step>
      <step>Establish success metrics and testing requirements.</step>
      <step>Generate the complete PRD using the technical issues template.</step>
    </steps>
  </instructions>

  <complexity_analysis>
    <automatic_guardrails_triggers>
      AI Guardrails Implementation Strategy is REQUIRED if ANY of these apply:
      <trigger>More than 5 files need modification</trigger>
      <trigger>Core application files are affected (components, APIs, database)</trigger>
      <trigger>Type safety improvements across multiple modules</trigger>
      <trigger>Refactoring that affects component interfaces</trigger>
      <trigger>Changes that could break existing functionality</trigger>
      <trigger>Dependency updates that might cause breaking changes</trigger>
      <trigger>Performance optimization requiring code restructuring</trigger>
      <trigger>Security fixes affecting multiple layers</trigger>
    </automatic_guardrails_triggers>

    <risk_assessment_matrix>
      <low_risk>Isolated changes, test files, documentation updates, single-file fixes</low_risk>
      <medium_risk>Multiple related files, component updates, API modifications</medium_risk>
      <high_risk>Core system changes, breaking changes, cross-cutting concerns</high_risk>
    </risk_assessment_matrix>

    <priority_determination>
      <critical>Security vulnerabilities, production bugs, system outages</critical>
      <high>Technical debt blocking development, performance issues, major bugs</high>
      <medium>Code quality improvements, minor refactoring, dependency updates</medium>
      <low>Documentation, minor optimizations, non-blocking improvements</low>
    </priority_determination>
  </complexity_analysis>

  <planning_block>
    Before writing the final PRD, use &lt;technical_planning&gt; tags to:
    <analysis_checklist>
      <item>Identify the root cause and scope of the technical issue.</item>
      <item>List all files that need modification with risk assessment.</item>
      <item>Determine dependencies between different parts of the fix.</item>
      <item>Assess potential impact on existing functionality.</item>
      <item>Check if AI guardrails triggers are met.</item>
      <item>Plan the implementation phases for safe execution.</item>
      <item>Identify testing requirements and validation checkpoints.</item>
      <item>Consider rollback strategies and safety measures.</item>
      <item>Estimate timeline based on complexity and risk.</item>
    </analysis_checklist>
  </planning_block>

  <ai_guardrails_strategy>
    <file_level_constraints>
      - Process maximum 1-2 files per implementation session
      - Start with lowest risk files (tests, utilities, isolated components)
      - End with highest risk files (core components, APIs, shared modules)
      - Maximum 15-20 lines of changes per AI session
    </file_level_constraints>

    <change_type_isolation>
      - Separate different types of fixes into different phases
      - Handle imports/dependencies separately from logic changes
      - Address type safety issues independently from functionality changes
      - Keep automated fixes separate from manual refactoring
    </change_type_isolation>

    <safety_prompts>
      - "Analyze impact on dependent files before making changes"
      - "Show only minimal, targeted changes for this specific issue"
      - "Identify files that import from this module"
      - "Preserve existing API contracts and interfaces"
      - "Limit changes to maximum 15 lines per response"
    </safety_prompts>

    <incremental_validation>
      - Test compilation after each file modification
      - Run relevant tests after each phase
      - Verify no new errors introduced
      - Check that specific issue was resolved
      - Validate integration points remain functional
    </incremental_validation>
  </ai_guardrails_strategy>

  <final_instruction>
    Generate a comprehensive technical PRD that follows the ~/templates/technical-issues-prd-template.md structure. Include automatic priority assessment, timeline calculation, detailed AI guardrails strategy, and implementation phases. The PRD should be ready for immediate use with Claude Code for safe, incremental implementation.
