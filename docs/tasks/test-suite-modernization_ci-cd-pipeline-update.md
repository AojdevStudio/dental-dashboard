# Task: Update CI/CD Pipeline for Hybrid Testing

## Description
Modify GitHub Actions workflow files to support the hybrid testing approach. This includes setting up Playwright browser installation, configuring parallel test execution for both Vitest and Playwright MCP, and ensuring proper test result reporting.

## Dependencies
- test-suite-modernization_vitest-config-update.md
- test-suite-modernization_migrate-server-component-tests.md

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Update GitHub Actions workflow for dual test execution
- [ ] Configure Playwright browser installation in CI
- [ ] Set up parallel execution for test types
- [ ] Implement proper test result aggregation
- [ ] Configure test failure reporting
- [ ] Optimize CI resource usage

## Technical Requirements
- Implementation approach: Incremental workflow updates with validation
- Performance constraints: Keep CI execution under 10 minutes
- Security considerations: Secure handling of test credentials

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] CI pipeline executes successfully
- [ ] Test results properly reported
- [ ] No increase in CI execution time
- [ ] Rollback plan documented

## Test Scenarios
Detailed scenarios that Test Writer should cover:
- Both test suites execute in CI
- Proper failure reporting for each test type
- Resource optimization validation
- Caching strategy for dependencies
- Matrix testing for different Node versions

## Implementation Notes
- Add Playwright installation step:
  ```yaml
  - name: Install Playwright Browsers
    run: pnpm exec playwright install --with-deps
  ```
- Configure parallel job execution
- Set up artifact upload for test results
- Maximum changes: 30-40 lines
- HIGH RISK: Test in feature branch first
