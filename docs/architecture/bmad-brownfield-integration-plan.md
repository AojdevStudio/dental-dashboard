# BMAD Brownfield Integration Plan
## Dental Practice Dashboard - Strategic Framework Adoption

**Document Type**: Architectural Integration Strategy  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Status**: Draft  
**Generated**: 2025-06-21  
**Integration Target**: 50% Complete Next.js/Supabase Dental Dashboard  

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the strategic integration of the BMAD (Breakthrough Method of Agile AI-driven Development) framework into an existing dental practice dashboard project that is approximately 50% complete. The integration leverages BMAD's multi-tool coordination capabilities while preserving existing investments in architecture, testing infrastructure, and development workflows.

### Integration Objectives

- **Accelerate Completion**: Use BMAD's agent-driven approach to complete remaining 50% of features
- **Preserve Investments**: Maintain existing architecture, testing infrastructure, and working systems
- **Enhance Workflows**: Integrate Linear (project management) + Obsidian (knowledge alignment) + TDD-Claude-Code (development execution)
- **Risk Mitigation**: Ensure zero disruption to current production systems and team workflows
- **Quality Assurance**: Leverage BMAD's systematic approach to increase test coverage from 74% to 90%+
