# Phase 3: RLS Implementation Validation Checklist

## Pre-Implementation Checks

- [ ] All tables from Phase 1 and Phase 2 are created successfully
- [ ] User model has auth_id field populated for test users
- [ ] user_clinic_roles table has test data for validation
- [ ] Database backup completed (if production data exists)
- [ ] Rollback script tested in development environment

## RLS Implementation Validation

### 1. Helper Functions
- [ ] `auth.get_user_clinics()` returns correct clinic list for authenticated users
- [ ] `auth.has_clinic_access()` correctly validates clinic access
- [ ] `auth.is_clinic_admin()` correctly identifies clinic administrators
- [ ] `auth.get_user_role()` returns correct role for user-clinic combination

### 2. Core Table Policies

#### Clinics Table
- [ ] Users can only see clinics they have access to
- [ ] Clinic admins can update their clinic details
- [ ] Non-admins cannot update clinic information
- [ ] New clinic creation is restricted (super admin only)

#### Users Table
- [ ] Users can see other users in their clinics
- [ ] Users cannot see users from other clinics
- [ ] Users can update their own profile
- [ ] Clinic admins can manage users in their clinic
- [ ] Non-admins cannot create or delete users

#### Providers Table
- [ ] Users can view providers in their clinics only
- [ ] Clinic admins can create/update/delete providers
- [ ] Non-admins cannot modify provider data

### 3. Multi-Tenant Data Tables

#### Financial Metrics
- [ ] Users can only view financial data for their clinics
- [ ] Authorized roles can create financial metrics
- [ ] Only clinic admins can delete financial metrics
- [ ] Cross-clinic data access is blocked

#### Appointment Metrics
- [ ] Appointment data is isolated by clinic
- [ ] Appropriate roles can update appointment metrics
- [ ] Historical data remains accessible to authorized users

#### Patient Metrics
- [ ] Patient metrics are clinic-scoped
- [ ] Aggregated data respects clinic boundaries
- [ ] Sensitive patient data is properly protected

### 4. Google Integration Tables

#### Google Credentials
- [ ] Only clinic admins can view/manage Google credentials
- [ ] Credentials are encrypted and clinic-isolated
- [ ] Token refresh maintains proper access control

#### Spreadsheet Connections
- [ ] Connections are visible only to authorized clinic users
- [ ] Only admins can create/modify connections
- [ ] Connection status updates respect permissions

### 5. User-Owned Resources

#### Dashboards
- [ ] Users can see their own dashboards
- [ ] Shared dashboards visible to clinic members
- [ ] Users cannot access dashboards from other clinics
- [ ] Dashboard creation/updates work correctly

#### Widgets
- [ ] Widget access follows dashboard permissions
- [ ] Widget data respects metric access rules
- [ ] Configuration changes are properly authorized

### 6. System Tables

#### ID Mappings
- [ ] Table is completely inaccessible to regular users
- [ ] Only service role can read/write
- [ ] Migration scripts can access when needed

#### Metric Aggregations
- [ ] Read-only access for authenticated users
- [ ] Only system processes can write
- [ ] Aggregations respect clinic boundaries

## Performance Validation

### 1. Query Performance
- [ ] Dashboard load time < 2 seconds with RLS
- [ ] Metric queries perform within acceptable limits
- [ ] Report generation doesn't timeout
- [ ] Bulk operations complete successfully

### 2. Index Usage
- [ ] All RLS-related indexes are being used
- [ ] No sequential scans on large tables
- [ ] Query plans show index usage
- [ ] No performance regression from baseline

### 3. Concurrent Access
- [ ] Multiple users can access simultaneously
- [ ] No deadlocks or blocking issues
- [ ] Proper isolation between sessions
- [ ] Connection pooling works correctly

## Security Validation

### 1. Data Isolation
- [ ] Create test data in multiple clinics
- [ ] Verify complete isolation between clinics
- [ ] Test with users having multiple clinic access
- [ ] Confirm no data leakage in any scenario

### 2. Permission Boundaries
- [ ] Each role can only perform allowed actions
- [ ] Privilege escalation is not possible
- [ ] Service role access is properly restricted
- [ ] API endpoints respect RLS policies

### 3. Edge Cases
- [ ] Inactive users cannot access data
- [ ] Deleted clinic data is inaccessible
- [ ] Null clinic_id handling works correctly
- [ ] System-wide data access is controlled

## Integration Testing

### 1. API Integration
- [ ] All API endpoints work with RLS enabled
- [ ] Error messages don't leak information
- [ ] Proper HTTP status codes returned
- [ ] Rate limiting works per clinic

### 2. Application Features
- [ ] User authentication flow works
- [ ] Dashboard creation and editing
- [ ] Metric data entry and updates
- [ ] Report generation with proper filtering
- [ ] Google Sheets sync respects boundaries

### 3. Background Jobs
- [ ] Scheduled aggregations run successfully
- [ ] Data sync jobs respect RLS
- [ ] Cleanup jobs work properly
- [ ] Email notifications sent correctly

## Rollback Readiness
