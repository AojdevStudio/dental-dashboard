# Phase 4: Data Migration Validation Checklist

## Pre-Migration Validation

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Database backup completed and verified
- [ ] Migration scripts deployed to target environment
- [ ] Environment variables configured correctly
- [ ] Database connection tested
- [ ] Sufficient disk space for logs and reports
- [ ] Migration user has necessary permissions

### Data Baseline
- [ ] Total record counts documented for all tables
- [ ] Sample data exported for comparison
- [ ] Foreign key relationships mapped
- [ ] Current ID formats documented
- [ ] Data quality issues identified and logged

### Script Preparation
- [ ] Migration scripts tested in staging
- [ ] Batch size configured appropriately
- [ ] Checkpoint directory created with write permissions
- [ ] Logging configuration verified
- [ ] Error handling tested with simulated failures

## Migration Execution

### User Migration
- [ ] All users have UUID assigned
- [ ] User UUID is unique across all records
- [ ] ID mapping created for each user
- [ ] Auth ID field prepared (can be null initially)
- [ ] No users lost during migration
- [ ] Foreign key relationships maintained

### Clinic Migration
- [ ] All clinics have UUID assigned
- [ ] Clinic UUID is unique
- [ ] ID mapping created for each clinic
- [ ] Clinic-user relationships preserved
- [ ] Clinic-provider relationships intact
- [ ] No orphaned clinic references

### Dashboard Migration
- [ ] All dashboards have UUID assigned
- [ ] Dashboard-user UUID reference populated
- [ ] ID mapping created for each dashboard
- [ ] Widget relationships maintained
- [ ] Dashboard ownership preserved
- [ ] No dashboards without valid user reference

### Relationship Integrity
- [ ] Provider-clinic relationships valid
- [ ] MetricValue-clinic relationships intact
- [ ] Goal-clinic relationships preserved
- [ ] DataSource-clinic relationships maintained
- [ ] Widget-dashboard relationships valid
- [ ] All foreign keys resolve correctly

## Post-Migration Validation

### Data Integrity Checks
- [ ] Row counts match pre-migration baseline
- [ ] No duplicate UUIDs in any table
- [ ] All ID mappings are unique
- [ ] No null UUIDs where expected
- [ ] Timestamps are reasonable (no future dates)
- [ ] Required fields remain populated

### UUID Validation
- [ ] All UUIDs follow proper format
- [ ] UUID uniqueness constraints enforced
- [ ] UUID indexes created successfully
- [ ] UUID fields are searchable
- [ ] No collision between generated UUIDs

### ID Mapping Validation
- [ ] Mapping exists for every migrated record
- [ ] Old ID -> New ID relationships are 1:1
- [ ] Table name correctly recorded
- [ ] Mappings are queryable
- [ ] No orphaned mappings

### Application Functionality
- [ ] Users can log in successfully
- [ ] Clinic data displays correctly
- [ ] Dashboards load without errors
- [ ] Metrics and goals accessible
- [ ] API endpoints return expected data
- [ ] No performance degradation

### Performance Metrics
- [ ] Query response times acceptable
- [ ] Index usage confirmed
- [ ] No table scans on UUID lookups
- [ ] Database CPU usage normal
- [ ] Connection pool stable

## Error Handling Validation

### Migration Logs
- [ ] All errors logged with context
- [ ] Error counts match expectations
- [ ] No critical errors missed
- [ ] Checkpoint files created correctly
- [ ] Reports generated successfully

### Recovery Testing
- [ ] Checkpoint resume functionality works
- [ ] Partial migration can be continued
- [ ] Error recovery procedures documented
- [ ] Team knows how to read logs
- [ ] Support contacts updated

## Rollback Readiness

### Rollback Preparation
- [ ] Rollback script tested in staging
- [ ] Rollback duration estimated
- [ ] Rollback triggers defined
- [ ] Team trained on rollback procedure
- [ ] Communication plan ready

### Rollback Validation
- [ ] All UUIDs can be removed
- [ ] ID mappings can be deleted
- [ ] Original IDs remain functional
- [ ] No data loss during rollback
- [ ] Application works post-rollback

## Business Validation

### Functional Testing
- [ ] Critical user workflows tested
- [ ] Admin functions verified
- [ ] Reporting features checked
- [ ] Integration points validated
- [ ] No business logic broken

### Data Accuracy
- [ ] Sample records manually verified
- [ ] Calculations still correct
- [ ] Historical data accessible
- [ ] Audit trails maintained
- [ ] No data corruption

## Documentation

### Technical Documentation
- [ ] Migration report generated
- [ ] Validation report created
- [ ] Error summary documented
- [ ] Performance metrics recorded
- [ ] Lessons learned captured

### Operational Documentation
