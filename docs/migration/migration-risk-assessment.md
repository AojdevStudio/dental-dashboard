# Migration Risk Assessment

## Critical Risk Areas

### 1. ID Type Conversion (String ‚Üí UUID)
**Risk Level**: üî¥ HIGH
**Impact**: System-wide

#### Risks:
- URL routing breaks (string IDs in paths)
- API contract changes
- Frontend state management issues
- Cache invalidation problems

#### Mitigation:
- Dual-ID support during transition
- API versioning with backward compatibility
- Comprehensive URL redirect mapping
- Frontend adapter layer

### 2. User Authentication Migration
**Risk Level**: üî¥ HIGH
**Impact**: All users

#### Risks:
- Users locked out during migration
- Password reset flows broken
- Session invalidation
- OAuth connection loss

#### Mitigation:
- Parallel auth systems
- Automated session migration
- Pre-migration user communication
- Emergency access procedures

### 3. Foreign Key Cascade Effects
**Risk Level**: üü° MEDIUM
**Impact**: Data integrity

#### Risks:
- Orphaned records
- Cascade deletion issues
- Circular dependencies
- Performance degradation

#### Mitigation:
- Detailed dependency mapping
- Cascade rules documentation
- Batch processing with checkpoints
- Integrity validation scripts

### 4. Google OAuth Token Migration
**Risk Level**: üü° MEDIUM
**Impact**: Integration functionality

#### Risks:
- Token decryption failures
- Lost refresh tokens
- API access interruption
- Re-authentication required

#### Mitigation:
- Token backup before migration
- Encryption key management
- Graceful degradation
- User notification system

## Data Volume Considerations

### Large Tables Assessment
Based on current schema, tables likely to have significant data:

1. **MetricValue**
   - Potentially millions of rows
   - Time-series data growth
   - Migration time: ~2-4 hours

2. **User Activity Logs**
   - High write volume
   - Historical data
   - Migration time: ~1-2 hours

3. **Google Sheets Sync Data**
   - Variable based on usage
   - Complex relationships
   - Migration time: ~30-60 minutes

### Performance Impact

#### During Migration:
- Database CPU: +40-60% utilization
- Memory usage: +2-3GB for mapping tables
- I/O operations: 3x normal load
- Query latency: +20-50ms expected

#### Mitigation:
- Off-peak migration windows
- Read replica for queries
- Connection pooling optimization
- Statement timeouts

## Complex Relationship Mappings

### Circular Dependencies
```
User ‚Üê ‚Üí Clinic (via user_clinic_roles)
Dashboard ‚Üí Widget ‚Üí MetricValue ‚Üí Provider ‚Üí Clinic
```

**Risk**: Constraint violations during migration
**Solution**: Deferred constraint checking

### Many-to-Many Relationships
- User ‚Üî Clinic
- Provider ‚Üî MetricDefinition
- Dashboard ‚Üî Metrics

**Risk**: Junction table migration complexity
**Solution**: Three-phase junction migration

## Rollback Complexity

### Phase Rollback Difficulty:
1. **Phase 1**: ‚úÖ Easy - Additive only
2. **Phase 2**: ‚úÖ Easy - Data population
3. **Phase 3**: üü° Medium - Foreign keys
4. **Phase 4**: üî¥ Hard - Auth integration
5. **Phase 5**: üü° Medium - RLS policies
6. **Phase 6**: üî¥ Hard - Final cutover

### Point of No Return
After Phase 4 (Auth Integration), rollback becomes significantly more complex due to:
- External system dependencies
- User session states
- Security implications

## Security Considerations

### During Migration:
1. **Exposed Data Risk**
   - Temporary tables with sensitive data
   - Logging might contain tokens
   - Backup files need encryption

2. **Access Control Gaps**
   - Period where both auth systems active
   - Potential privilege escalation
   - Audit trail gaps

3. **Token Security**
   - Decryption/re-encryption exposure
   - Key rotation timing
   - Token validity windows

## Business Continuity

### Acceptable Downtime Windows:
- **Read Operations**: Zero downtime required
- **Write Operations**: 5-minute windows acceptable
- **Auth Services**: 1-minute maximum
- **Sync Services**: Can be offline for 1 hour

### Critical Path Operations:
1. User login/logout
2. Metric data recording
3. Dashboard viewing
4. Report generation

### Degraded Service Plan:
- Phase 1-2: Full service maintained
- Phase 3-4: Read-only mode possible
- Phase 5-6: Scheduled maintenance window

## Success Metrics

### Technical Success Criteria:
- [ ] Zero data loss (100% row count match)
- [ ] All foreign keys valid
- [ ] No orphaned records
- [ ] Performance within 10% baseline
- [ ] All tests passing

### Business Success Criteria:
- [ ] User complaints < 5
- [ ] No revenue impact
- [ ] Sync services resume within 2 hours
- [ ] Support ticket volume < 2x normal

## Go/No-Go Decision Points

### Phase 1 ‚Üí Phase 2:
- All new tables created successfully
- No impact on existing operations
- Rollback tested and verified

### Phase 3 ‚Üí Phase 4:
- All UUIDs generated and mapped
- Foreign key test migration successful
- Performance metrics acceptable

### Phase 4 ‚Üí Phase 5:
- Auth integration tested with subset
- User access verified
- Emergency access procedures ready

### Phase 5 ‚Üí Phase 6:
- RLS policies validated
- Full integration test passed
- Business stakeholder approval

## Emergency Procedures

### Immediate Rollback Triggers:
1. Data corruption detected
2. Auth system failure
3. Performance degradation > 50%
4. Cascading errors in logs

### Communication Plan:
- Engineering: Slack #incident channel
- Business: Email to stakeholders
- Users: In-app notification system
- Support: Pre-written templates

### Recovery Time Objectives:
- Detection: < 5 minutes
- Decision: < 10 minutes
- Rollback execution: < 30 minutes
- Service restoration: < 1 hour
