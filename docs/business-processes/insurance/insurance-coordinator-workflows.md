## 🚀 KamDental Insurance Escalation Guide
#### When to Handle vs. When to Escalate

### ◆ Level 1 – Handles These Issues Independently
Insurance coordinator/Biller is expected to **resolve these cases on her own** using the provided guides and templates.

**✅ Routine Insurance Verifications & Benefit Checks**
*   Checking patient eligibility, annual max, deductible, and waiting periods.
*   Logging benefit details into Open Dental.

**✅ Standard Claim Submissions & Follow-Ups**
*   Submitting claims with correct attachments (X-rays, narratives, perio charts).
*   Checking clearinghouse (Vyne) for rejections and resubmitting.
*   Following up on claims **30+ days old**.
*   Documenting all insurance conversations with reference numbers.

**✅ Denials Due to Missing Information**
*   Identifying missing attachments and resubmitting the claim.
*   If denied due to incorrect coding, correcting it and resubmitting.
*   Informing patients of insurance denials using pre-written scripts.

**✅ Patient Balance & Downgrade Explanations**
*   Notifying patients when insurance downgrades coverage (e.g., pays for a metal crown instead of porcelain).
*   Offering payment plans or alternatives.
*   Logging all communication in Open Dental.

**✅ Payment Posting & Adjustments**
*   Applying insurance payments correctly in Open Dental.
*   Identifying write-offs and contractual adjustments.
*   Ensuring patient accounts are balanced after insurance payments.

### ◆ Level 2 – Escalate to Supervisor (Office Manager or Veronica)
Insurance coordinator/Biller should escalate these issues **after making an initial attempt** to resolve them.

**🚨 Claim Has Been Unpaid for 45+ Days**
*   Billing dept. should **call insurance twice** (get a reference number).
*   If still unresolved, **escalate to a supervisor** for further action.

**🚨 Repeated Denials with No Clear Explanation**
*   If Billing dept. has **called insurance and corrected the claim** but it keeps getting denied **without a valid reason**, escalate.

**🚨 Patient Disputes a Balance & Refuses to Pay**
*   Billing dept. should explain **why the balance exists** (downgrade, deductible, out-of-network).
*   If the patient **argues or refuses to pay**, escalate to a supervisor.

**🚨 Claim Requires an Appeal**
*   Billing dept. files **first-level appeals** for simple denials.
*   If appeal requires **detailed documentation, a peer-to-peer review, or doctor involvement**, escalate.

**🚨 Insurance Company Requests Additional Justification**
*   If insurance requests additional **clinical notes or detailed doctor explanations**, escalate to the doctor.

### ◆ Level 3 – Escalate to Dr. Kam or Dr. Ossie
**Provider-Level Escalations (Doctor's Input Needed)**
Insurance coordinator/Biller should **only escalate to Dr. Kam or Dr. Ossie** if the situation involves:

*   **Peer-to-Peer Review Requests** – Insurance asks to speak to the treating dentist before approving a claim.
*   **Medical Necessity Disputes** – If an insurance company argues a procedure wasn't needed.
*   **Large Claim Denials ($3,000+ Procedures)** – Major cases like **full-mouth reconstructions, implants, or bridges** that could significantly impact the practice.

### ◆ Emergency Situations – Immediate Escalation
Billing dept. should **immediately alert management** in these urgent cases:

**🚨 HIPAA Violation or Data Breach**
*   If patient information is exposed, lost, or accessed improperly.

**🚨 Insurance Fraud Suspicion**
*   If a patient or insurance company gives suspicious or fraudulent information.

**🚨 Legal Threats from Patients or Insurance**
*   If a patient threatens **legal action** over a claim or balance.

### ✨ Final Notes for All:
*   **Trust your judgment!** Handle routine tasks, but don't hesitate to escalate when needed.
*   **Always document all communication with insurance and patients before escalating.**
*   **Use the escalation flowchart to decide the next step.**
