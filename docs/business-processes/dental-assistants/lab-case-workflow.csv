,"This system helps manage lab cases by automatically organizing them based on status. Key features include:                                                                                                                                1. Status-based case organization (e.g., 'Completed', 'Attention Needed').
2. Automatic timestamp updates for edits.
3. Monthly fee reporting by doctor.
4. Automated daily checks for overdue scheduled appointments (updates status to 'Attention Needed').
5. Duplicate row removal.
6. Environment configuration for multiple locations. 
Key Workflows:
- Lab Case Entry: Dental Assistants enter new lab cases. Crucially, the 'Total Fee' column should be filled with the cost of the lab case, taken directly from the lab invoice.
- Automated Case Routing: Cases are moved to different sheets based on 'APPOINTMENT STATUS' and 'INSURANCE STATUS'.
- Automated Overdue Updates: Daily, the system checks for 'SCHEDULED' cases with past 'SEAT DATES' and changes their status to 'ATTENTION NEEDED'.
- Monthly Fee Reports: The billing department can generate reports. These reports sum the 'Total Fee' (lab case costs) for each doctor from completed cases within a specific month.
