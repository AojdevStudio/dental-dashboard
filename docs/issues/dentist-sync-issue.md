🚨 Problem Statement

  Dentist Google Apps Script sync processing 0 rows across 19 sheets despite successful
  setup. Hygiene sync works (471 rows), dentist sync fails.

  🔍 Investigation Summary

  Initial Hypothesis (INCORRECT)

  - Suspected missing API endpoint
  - Thought 403 permission errors were the cause
  - Believed Supabase RLS policies were blocking access

  Actual Root Cause Analysis

  Issue 1: Missing Configuration Constant

  File: /scripts/google-apps-script/dentist-sync/config.gs
  Problem: Script referenced DASHBOARD_API_URL_PROPERTY_KEY but constant was undefined
  Status: ✅ FIXED - Added missing constant

  Issue 2: Column Mapping Logic Failure

  File: /scripts/google-apps-script/dentist-sync/mapping.gs
  Problem:
  1. else if chain prevented multiple column mappings
  2. Exact string matching too brittle for production columns
  3. When mapping.date === -1, sync returns 0 rows immediately

  Critical Code Path:
  // sync.gs lines 82-85
  if (mapping.date === -1) {
    Logger.log(`Warning: No date column found in sheet ${monthTab}`);
    return 0; // ← THIS causes 0 rows processed
  }

  🔧 Fixes Applied

  Fix 1: Added Missing Constant

  // Added to config.gs
  const DASHBOARD_API_URL_PROPERTY_KEY = 'DENTIST_DASHBOARD_API_URL';

  Fix 2: Updated Column Mapping Logic

  // Changed from else-if chain to individual if statements
  // Changed from exact matching to pattern matching
  if (mapping.verifiedProductionHumble === -1 && cleanHeader.includes('verified production')
  && cleanHeader.includes('humble')) {
    mapping.verifiedProductionHumble = index;
  }

  📊 Data Analysis

  CSV Headers (Actual)

  Date,Enter your hours worked,Verified Production (Billing Department Only) Humble,Verified
  Production (Billing Department Only) Baytown,Location,Notes from Billing Department,Total
  Production,Baytown Production,Humble Production,Monthly Production Goal (Both
  Offices),Monthly Production per hour,Average daily Production,Over/Under Production
  goal,30% Production,UUID

  Expected Mappings

  - Date → mapping.date (index 0)
  - Verified Production (Billing Department Only) Humble → mapping.verifiedProductionHumble
  (index 2)
  - Verified Production (Billing Department Only) Baytown → mapping.verifiedProductionBaytown
   (index 3)

  🚫 Status: FIXES DIDN'T WORK

  Despite logical fixes, dentist sync still processes 0 rows.

  🔍 Next Steps for Investigation

  Priority 1: Debug Column Mapping

  Add extensive logging to verify column mapping is working:
  // Add to mapHeaders_ function
  console.log('Raw headers:', headers);
  console.log('Clean header 0:', String(headers[0]).toLowerCase().trim());
  console.log('Date pattern match:', DENTIST_COLUMN_HEADERS.DATE.some(pattern =>
    String(headers[0]).toLowerCase().trim().includes(pattern)));

  Priority 2: Compare Working vs Broken

  Working: Hygiene sync processes 471 rows
  Broken: Dentist sync processes 0 rows
  - Compare exact script differences
  - Check if data structure/format differs between spreadsheets

  Priority 3: Verify Data Rows

  // Add to syncSheetData_ function  
  console.log('Total data rows found:', dataRows.length);
  console.log('First 3 data rows:', dataRows.slice(0, 3));
  console.log('Date column values:', dataRows.slice(0, 5).map(row => row[mapping.date]));

  Priority 4: Test Minimal Case

  Create simple test with just date column to isolate mapping vs data issues.

  📁 Files Modified

  1. /scripts/google-apps-script/dentist-sync/config.gs - Added missing constant
  2. /scripts/google-apps-script/dentist-sync/mapping.gs - Updated column mapping logic
  3. /docs/dentist-sync-issue-resolution.md - Documentation (can be deleted)

  🎯 Key Insights for Next Engineer

  1. API endpoint not needed - Direct Supabase REST works
  2. Configuration fixed - No more undefined constant errors
  3. Core issue remains - Something in data processing logic still failing
  4. Hygiene sync works - Use as reference for working implementation
  5. Focus on mapping - Date column mapping likely still failing despite fixes

  🚨 Critical Debug Commands

  Run these in Google Apps Script console to diagnose:
  // Test column mapping directly
  const sheet = SpreadsheetApp.openById(DENTIST_SHEET_ID).getSheets()[0];
  const headers = getSheetHeaders_(sheet);
  const mapping = mapHeaders_(headers);
  console.log('Headers:', headers);
  console.log('Mapping:', mapping);

  Status: Unresolved - requires deeper debugging of actual data processing flow.
