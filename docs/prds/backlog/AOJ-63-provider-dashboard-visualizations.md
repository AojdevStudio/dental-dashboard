# PRD: Provider Dashboard Visualizations with KPI Charts and Real Database Data (AOJ-63)

## Document Information

- **Issue ID:** AOJ-63
- **Title:** Provider Dashboard Visualizations with KPI Charts and Real Database Data
- **Priority:** **High** (Auto-calculated: Complex dashboard feature blocking provider management workflows)
- **Complexity:** **High** (Multiple file modifications, new routing, database queries, visualization components)
- **Due Date:** June 22, 2025 (4-5 days from start - Fast-shipping standard for high-priority dashboard features)
- **Created:** June 17, 2025
- **Author:** Senior Technical PM
- **Status:** Ready for Implementation

## Executive Summary

The current providers page lacks essential dashboard visualizations and KPI charts, with provider detail pages resulting in 404 errors. This PRD addresses the implementation of comprehensive provider dashboard visualizations including individual provider detail pages, performance metrics, financial KPIs, and interactive charts using real database data. The implementation requires **AI Guardrails Strategy** due to complex routing changes, multiple file modifications, database query optimization, and visualization component integration that could impact existing provider functionality.

### AI Guardrails Approach
- **Phased Implementation**: 4-phase approach with validation checkpoints after each phase
- **File-Level Constraints**: Maximum 1-2 files per session, starting with routing and progressing to complex visualizations
- **Change Type Isolation**: Routing → Data Layer → Visualization → Integration
- **Risk Management**: Preserve existing provider listing functionality throughout implementation

## Background and Strategic Fit

### Current State
- ✅ Basic providers listing page displays correctly with provider cards
- ✅ Provider filtering and search functionality exists (with known issues in AOJ-64) - This should be fixed before this PRD is implemented.
- ❌ **Critical Issue**: Provider detail pages completely missing (404 errors when clicking "View" buttons)
- ❌ No provider KPI charts or performance metrics visible
- ❌ No dashboard visualizations or trend displays  
- ❌ Missing financial metrics integration (production, overhead, goals)
- ❌ No provider performance comparison capabilities

### Strategic Fit
- **Primary Goal**: Transform basic provider listing into comprehensive dashboard interface
- **Business Value**: Enable data-driven provider performance management and decision making

## AI Guardrails Implementation Strategy

### Automatic Triggers Met
- ✅ More than 5 files need modification (12+ files identified)
- ✅ Core application files affected (routing, APIs, database queries)
- ✅ Changes that could break existing functionality (provider navigation)
- ✅ Performance optimization requiring code restructuring (complex data aggregations)

### File-Level Constraints
- **Maximum Files per Session**: 1-2 files only to prevent cascading errors
- **Change Limits**: Maximum 15-20 lines of changes per AI session
- **Processing Order**: 
  1. Start with routing and basic structure (lowest complexity)
  2. Progress to data layer and API endpoints (medium complexity)
  3. End with visualization components (highest complexity)

### Change Type Isolation

#### Phase 1: Routing Foundation
- **Scope**: Create provider detail page routing structure
- **Files**: Dynamic route pages, loading, error components
- **Safety**: Basic structure only, no complex logic
- **Validation**: Route accessibility, parameter handling

#### Phase 2: Data Layer Implementation
- **Scope**: Database queries, API endpoints, metrics calculations
- **Files**: Database queries, API routes, calculation utilities
- **Safety**: One query type at a time, validate data accuracy
- **Validation**: API response testing, query performance

#### Phase 3: Visualization Components
- **Scope**: Chart components and dashboard layout
- **Files**: Chart components, dashboard containers
- **Safety**: One chart type per session, test rendering
- **Validation**: Visual testing, data binding verification

#### Phase 4: Integration and Optimization
- **Scope**: Connect all components, performance optimization
- **Files**: Integration components, navigation updates
- **Safety**: Preserve existing functionality during integration
- **Validation**: End-to-end testing, performance benchmarking

### Safety Prompts for AI Sessions
- "Create only basic routing structure without complex dashboard logic"
- "Implement one database query at a time with performance validation"
- "Build one chart component with sample data before connecting real data"
- "Show minimal diff for navigation changes, preserve existing provider listing"
- "Limit changes to maximum 15 lines per response"
- "Test compilation and basic functionality after each change"

### Incremental Validation Protocol
- **After each file**: Run `pnpm tsc --noEmit` for compilation check
- **After Phase 1**: Test provider detail page routing and parameter handling
- **After Phase 2**: Validate API endpoints and data accuracy with Postman/curl
- **After Phase 3**: Test chart rendering and data visualization
- **After Phase 4**: Complete end-to-end testing and performance validation
