# Dashboard Performance Optimization

## Summary

The dental dashboard application currently experiences significant performance issues with page load times averaging 1.7 seconds, particularly affecting the integrations page and other dashboard routes. This PRD outlines a comprehensive performance optimization initiative to reduce load times to under 500ms through database query optimization, intelligent caching strategies, and architectural improvements.

The primary bottlenecks identified include expensive database queries in the layout component, redundant auth context fetching, lack of caching mechanisms, and middleware overhead. This optimization will improve user experience, reduce server load, and enhance overall application scalability.

## User Stories

### As a dental practice user
- **I want** dashboard pages to load quickly (under 500ms) **so that** I can efficiently navigate between different sections without waiting
- **I want** smooth transitions between pages **so that** my workflow isn't interrupted by loading delays
- **I want** the application to feel responsive **so that** I can focus on my work rather than waiting for the interface

### As a system administrator
- **I want** reduced database load **so that** the system can handle more concurrent users efficiently
- **I want** optimized query patterns **so that** database costs remain manageable as the user base grows
- **I want** performance monitoring **so that** I can proactively identify and address performance issues

### As a developer
- **I want** cached data strategies **so that** I don't need to re-fetch the same information repeatedly
- **I want** optimized database queries **so that** the application scales well with increased data volume
- **I want** performance metrics **so that** I can measure the impact of optimizations

## Functional Expectations

### Performance Targets
- **Page Load Time**: Reduce from 1.7s to <500ms for all dashboard pages
- **Time to First Contentful Paint**: <200ms
- **Database Query Reduction**: Reduce redundant queries by 70%
- **Cache Hit Rate**: Achieve 80%+ cache hit rate for auth and clinic data

### Caching Strategy
- **Auth Context Caching**: Cache user authentication and permissions for 5 minutes
- **Clinic Data Caching**: Cache clinic information for 15 minutes with smart invalidation
- **React Query Integration**: Implement client-side caching for all data fetching
- **Stale-While-Revalidate**: Use SWR pattern for optimal user experience

### Database Optimization
- **Query Consolidation**: Combine multiple auth-related queries into single optimized queries
- **Selective Data Fetching**: Only fetch required fields in layout queries
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimize Prisma connection pool settings
- **Index Optimization**: Ensure proper database indexes for auth and clinic queries

### Loading States
- **Skeleton Loading**: Implement skeleton screens for all major components
- **Progressive Loading**: Load critical content first, then enhance with additional data
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful handling of performance-related errors
