# Providers Main Page

## Summary

Create a comprehensive Providers page at `/dashboard/providers` that serves as the main hub for viewing and managing dental providers (dentists, hygienists, specialists) within the practice. This page will provide an overview of all providers, their performance metrics, and quick access to provider-specific information and actions. The page is distinct from the administrative settings/providers page and focuses on operational provider management and performance monitoring.
