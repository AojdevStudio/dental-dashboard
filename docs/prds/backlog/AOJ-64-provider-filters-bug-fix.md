# PRD: Fix Provider Page Filters Not Working (AOJ-64)

## Summary

This PRD addresses critical functionality bugs in the provider page filtering system where search and dropdown filters are completely non-functional, preventing users from efficiently finding and managing providers. The issue affects core workflow functionality for clinic management, making it impossible to filter providers by type, status, location, or search criteria. This bug significantly impacts user productivity and represents a critical system functionality failure that requires immediate resolution.

## Priority & Timeline Assessment

- **Priority**: **Critical**
  - **Reasoning**: Core functionality completely broken, affects primary user workflows, impacts all user roles who need to manage providers
  - **Business Impact**: High - prevents efficient provider management, reduces operational efficiency
  - **User Impact**: Severe - users cannot perform basic filtering operations essential for daily operations
- **Timeline**: **1-2 Days**
  - **Reasoning**: Bug fix with clear scope, critical priority requires immediate resolution
  - **Fast-shipping Standard**: Critical issues resolved within 24-48 hours

## User Stories

- **As an Office Manager, I want to search for providers by name so that I can quickly find specific providers without scrolling through the entire list.**
- **As an Office Manager, I want to filter providers by type (dentist, hygienist) so that I can focus on specific provider categories for management tasks.**
- **As an Office Manager, I want to filter providers by status (active, inactive) so that I can manage staffing and scheduling effectively.**
- **As an Office Manager, I want to filter providers by location so that I can manage multi-location practices efficiently.**
- **As a Front Desk Staff member, I want to use the clear filters button so that I can reset all filters and view all providers again.**
- **As any user, I want to see accurate provider counts that match the displayed results so that I can trust the system's data integrity.**

## Functional Expectations

### Current Broken Functionality (As Identified in Testing)

1. **Search Logic Inversion Bug**
   - **Problem**: Search for "Enih" returns "Kamdi" instead of "Chinyere Enih"
   - **Expected**: Search should return providers whose names contain the search term
   - **Root Cause**: Likely inverted boolean logic or incorrect field matching

2. **Non-Functional Dropdown Filters**
   - **Problem**: Provider type, status, and location filters have no effect on results
   - **Expected**: Selecting filter values should immediately update the provider list
   - **Root Cause**: Filter state not connected to query parameters or API calls

3. **Broken Clear Filters Button**
   - **Problem**: Clear filters button does not reset filter state or refresh results
   - **Expected**: Button should reset all filters and display all providers
   - **Root Cause**: State management not properly handling filter reset

4. **Provider Count Discrepancy**
   - **Problem**: Shows "3 providers" but displays only 2 providers
   - **Expected**: Count should match displayed results exactly
   - **Root Cause**: Count calculation not respecting applied filters

### Required Functionality After Fix

1. **Search Functionality**
   - Real-time search as user types (debounced)
   - Case-insensitive partial matching on provider names
   - Search across first name, last name, and full name combinations
   - Clear search with X button or empty input

2. **Dropdown Filters**
   - Provider type filter (dentist, hygienist, specialist, other)
   - Status filter (active, inactive, all)
   - Location filter (based on provider assignments)
   - Filters should combine with AND logic (all selected filters apply)

3. **Filter Management**
   - Clear all filters button resets to default state
   - Individual filter clearing capability
   - Filter state persistence during session
   - URL parameter reflection for bookmarkable filtered views

4. **Data Integrity**
   - Accurate provider count matching displayed results
   - Consistent data between filters and results
   - Proper loading states during filter operations
   - Error handling for filter failures

## Affected Files

### High Priority Investigation Files
- `src/hooks/use-providers.ts` - Provider data fetching and filtering logic
- `src/components/providers/provider-filters.tsx` - Filter UI components and state management
- `src/app/api/providers/route.ts` - API endpoint query parameter handling
- `src/lib/database/queries/providers.ts` - Database query filtering logic

### Medium Priority Files
- `src/app/(dashboard)/providers/page.tsx` - Main providers page integration
- `src/components/providers/provider-grid.tsx` - Provider display and count logic
- `src/types/providers.ts` - Provider filter type definitions

### Low Priority Files
- `src/components/common/filters.tsx` - Generic filter components (if exists)
- `src/lib/utils/search.ts` - Search utility functions (if exists)

## Implementation Strategy

### AI Guardrails Implementation Strategy

**Complexity Triggers Met:**
- ✅ Affects more than 3 files (7 files identified)
- ✅ Involves type safety improvements (filter types)
- ✅ Has complex component dependencies (hooks, API, UI components)
- ✅ Could impact multiple existing features (provider management workflow)
- ✅ Requires debugging existing code (high risk for breaking changes)

**File-Level Constraints:**
- Maximum 2 files per AI session to prevent cascading errors
- Focus on one filter type per session (search, then dropdowns, then clear)
- Validate each fix independently before proceeding to next component

**Change Type Isolation:**
- **Phase 1**: Fix search logic in isolation (hooks + API)
- **Phase 2**: Fix dropdown filters (components + state management)
- **Phase 3**: Fix clear functionality and count accuracy
- **Phase 4**: Integration testing and edge case handling

**Incremental Validation Protocol:**
- Test each filter type individually after fixes
- Validate API responses with different filter combinations
- Check UI state management with browser dev tools
- Verify count accuracy after each phase

**Safety Prompts for AI Sessions:**
- "Fix only the search logic without modifying dropdown filter code"
- "Update only dropdown filter state management, preserve existing search functionality"
- "Show minimal diff for each change and explain the specific bug being fixed"
- "Test the specific filter functionality after each change before proceeding"

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Risk Areas
- **Risk**: Breaking existing provider data fetching while fixing filters
  - **Mitigation**: Test core provider loading before and after each change
  - **Rollback Plan**: Revert to working provider display if filtering breaks core functionality

- **Risk**: Introducing performance issues with real-time filtering
  - **Mitigation**: Implement proper debouncing and optimize database queries
  - **Monitoring**: Track query performance and response times

### Medium Risk Areas
- **Risk**: State management conflicts between different filter types
  - **Mitigation**: Use isolated state updates and test filter combinations
  - **Validation**: Test all filter combinations manually

- **Risk**: API parameter handling causing server errors
  - **Mitigation**: Validate API parameters and implement proper error handling
  - **Testing**: Test API endpoint directly with various parameter combinations

### Low Risk Areas
- **Risk**: UI styling inconsistencies after component updates
  - **Mitigation**: Follow existing design patterns and test visual consistency
  - **Review**: Visual review of filter components after changes
