## 3. Technical Implementation Strategy

### Leverage Existing Architecture Patterns

```typescript
// Build Upon Established Patterns
const implementationStrategy = {
  componentArchitecture: {
    pattern: "Compound Components (already established)",
    example: "ProviderCard.Root, .Header, .Metrics, .Actions",
    newComponents: "KPIDashboard.Root, .MetricGroup, .ChartSection"
  },
  
  apiPatterns: {
    middleware: "Use existing withAuth + authContext patterns",
    validation: "Extend existing Zod schemas",
    responses: "Use apiSuccess/apiError/apiPaginated utilities",
    multiTenant: "Leverage existing RLS context functions"
  },
  
  testingStrategy: {
    unit: "Vitest with existing test utilities",
    integration: "Local Supabase test database",
    e2e: "Playwright with existing browser configurations",
    rls: "Transaction-based multi-tenant test scenarios"
  }
};
```

### Database & Query Optimization

```sql
-- Extend Existing Schema (Minimal Changes)
-- Most tables already exist, add only essential fields:

ALTER TABLE providers ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS performance_targets JSONB;
ALTER TABLE clinics ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS goal_templates JSONB;

-- Create minimal new tables for goal tracking:
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS clinic_goals (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  clinic_id uuid REFERENCES clinics(uuid_id),
  target_type varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  target_value decimal(10,2),
  timeframe_start date,
  timeframe_end date,
  status varchar(20) DEFAULT 'active'
);

-- Apply existing RLS patterns
CREATE POLICY clinic_goals_isolation ON clinic_goals
  FOR ALL TO authenticated
  USING (clinic_id = get_current_clinic_id());
```

### Component Implementation Plan

```typescript
// KPI Dashboard Architecture
// File: src/components/dashboard/kpi-dashboard.tsx

export const KPIDashboard = {
  Root: ({ children, clinicId }: KPIDashboardProps) => {
    // Use existing authContext and clinicSelector patterns
    return (
      <div className="dashboard-grid">
        <KPIProvider clinicId={clinicId}>
          {children}
        </KPIProvider>
      </div>
    );
  },
  
  MetricGroup: ({ title, metrics }: MetricGroupProps) => {
    // Extend existing MetricCard component
    return (
      <Card>
        <CardHeader>{title}</CardHeader>
        <CardContent>
          {metrics.map(metric => (
            <MetricCard key={metric.id} {...metric} />
          ))}
        </CardContent>
      </Card>
    );
  },
  
  ChartSection: ({ chartType, data }: ChartSectionProps) => {
    // Use existing ChartContainer and chart components
    return (
      <ChartContainer>
        {chartType === 'line' && <LineChart data={data} />}
        {chartType === 'bar' && <BarChart data={data} />}
      </ChartContainer>
    );
  }
};
```
