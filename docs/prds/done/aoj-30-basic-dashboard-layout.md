# AOJ-30: Basic Dashboard Layout

## Summary

Create the fundamental dashboard layout and navigation structure for the dental practice analytics dashboard. This includes implementing a professional sidebar navigation, top navigation bar, and responsive main content area that serves as the foundation for all role-based dashboard views. The layout will be desktop-focused, following medical-grade design principles with proper accessibility support.

## Functional Expectations

### Navigation Structure
**Sidebar Navigation (280px width, collapsible to 64px):**
- Dashboard (home/overview)
- Production (dentist and hygienist production data)
- Providers (provider management and performance)
- Reports (analytics and export features)
- Goals (goal setting and tracking)
- Integrations (Google Sheets and other connections)
- Settings (clinic, users, and system configuration)

**Top Navigation Bar (64px height):**
- Date range picker for filtering data
- Global search functionality
- Notification bell icon
- Settings gear icon
- User profile dropdown with logout

### Layout Behavior
- **Responsive Design**: Support desktop breakpoints (1024px+, 1440px+)
- **Sidebar State**: Collapsible sidebar with persistent state management
- **Content Area**: Flexible main content area with proper padding and spacing
- **Navigation Highlighting**: Active page indication with primary blue accent
- **Hover States**: Consistent hover effects following design system

### Component Architecture
- **Reusable Layout Components**: Sidebar, TopNav, MainContent wrappers
- **Navigation Components**: NavItem, NavSection, UserDropdown
- **Responsive Containers**: Proper grid and flexbox layouts
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loading for navigation and content areas

### Accessibility Requirements
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility with proper tab order
- **Focus Indicators**: Clear focus states with 2px primary blue outline
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- **Color Contrast**: WCAG AA compliance (4.5:1 minimum contrast ratio)
- **Skip Links**: "Skip to main content" for efficient navigation

## Affected Files

### New Components
- `src/components/common/sidebar.tsx` - Main sidebar navigation component
- `src/components/common/top-nav.tsx` - Top navigation bar with user controls
- `src/components/common/nav-item.tsx` - Reusable navigation item component
- `src/components/common/user-dropdown.tsx` - User profile dropdown menu
- `src/components/common/dashboard-layout.tsx` - Main layout wrapper component

### Layout Files
- `src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` - Dashboard layout with sidebar and top nav
- `src/components/ui/navigation-menu.tsx` - Enhanced navigation menu component (if not exists)

### Styling and Configuration
- `src/styles/globals.css` - Layout-specific global styles
- `tailwind.config.js` - Ensure proper breakpoints and spacing utilities
- `src/lib/utils/navigation.ts` - Navigation state management utilities

### Type Definitions
- `src/lib/types/navigation.ts` - Navigation item and state type definitions
- `src/lib/types/layout.ts` - Layout component prop types

## Additional Considerations

### Performance Optimization
- Implement proper code splitting for navigation components
- Use React.memo for navigation items to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Optimize sidebar collapse/expand animations for smooth performance

### Future Extensibility
- Design navigation structure to accommodate additional menu items
- Create flexible layout system that supports different content types
- Implement role-based navigation visibility (foundation for future role restrictions)

### Design System Integration
- Follow Shadcn UI component patterns and styling
- Implement consistent spacing using Tailwind's 4px increment system
- Use design brief color palette (Primary Blue #2563eb, Secondary Slate #475569)
- Maintain Inter font family throughout navigation elements

### State Management
- Implement sidebar collapse state persistence (localStorage)
- Create navigation context for active page tracking
- Prepare foundation for user role-based navigation filtering

### Browser Compatibility
- Ensure layout works across modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Test responsive behavior at key breakpoints (1024px, 1280px, 1440px+)
- Validate accessibility across different browser/screen reader combinations

### Testing Considerations
- Unit tests for navigation components
- Integration tests for layout state management
- Accessibility testing with automated tools and manual verification
- Visual regression testing for layout consistency
