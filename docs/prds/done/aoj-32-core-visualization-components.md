# AOJ-32: Core Visualization Components

## Summary

Develop essential visualization components for the dental practice analytics dashboard to enable data-driven decision making. This feature will provide practice managers, dentists, and administrators with interactive charts, KPI cards, and a flexible grid layout system to visualize key performance metrics including financial data, patient statistics, appointment trends, and provider performance.

The visualization system will be built using modern React charting libraries with full TypeScript support, responsive design, and accessibility compliance to ensure optimal user experience across all devices and user capabilities.

## User Stories

### As a Practice Manager
- I want to view financial KPIs (revenue, collections, outstanding) in easy-to-read cards so I can quickly assess practice performance
- I want to see revenue trends over time in interactive charts so I can identify patterns and make informed business decisions
- I want to compare provider performance metrics side-by-side so I can optimize scheduling and resource allocation

### As a Dentist
- I want to visualize my patient appointment trends and treatment statistics so I can understand my practice patterns
- I want to see my production metrics compared to goals in clear visual formats so I can track my performance
- I want to access these visualizations on both desktop and mobile devices for flexibility

### As a Practice Administrator
- I want to arrange dashboard components in a customizable grid layout so I can prioritize the most important metrics
- I want to see real-time updates of key metrics without manual refresh so I can monitor practice operations efficiently
- I want to export visualization data for reporting purposes so I can share insights with stakeholders

### As a System User
- I want visualizations to load quickly even with large datasets so I can maintain productivity
- I want accessible visualizations that work with screen readers so all team members can use the system
- I want consistent visual design that matches the medical/dental industry standards

## Functional Expectations

### Chart Components
- **Line Charts**: Time-series data visualization for trends (revenue over time, patient visits, etc.)
- **Bar Charts**: Comparative data visualization (provider performance, treatment types, monthly comparisons)
- **Pie/Doughnut Charts**: Composition data (treatment mix, payment methods, patient demographics)
- **Area Charts**: Cumulative data visualization (total collections, patient growth)
- **Interactive Features**: Hover tooltips, zoom functionality, data point selection
- **Responsive Design**: Automatic resizing and mobile-optimized layouts
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loaders and progress indicators
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for data loading failures

### KPI Card Component
- **Metric Display**: Large, prominent number display with proper formatting
- **Trend Indicators**: Up/down arrows with percentage change and color coding
- **Comparison Data**: Current vs. previous period, actual vs. goal
- **Contextual Information**: Time period, data source, last updated timestamp
- **Action Triggers**: Click-through to detailed views or drill-down functionality
- **Responsive Layout**: Stacked layout for mobile, grid layout for desktop
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML structure

### Dashboard Grid Layout
- **Flexible Grid System**: CSS Grid-based layout with configurable columns and rows
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Component repositioning capability (future enhancement)
- **Responsive Breakpoints**: Mobile (1 column), tablet (2 columns), desktop (3-4 columns)
- **Component Sizing**: Small, medium, large component size options
- **Spacing Management**: Consistent gaps and padding throughout the grid
- **Overflow Handling**: Proper scrolling and content management for smaller screens

### Data Integration
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket or polling-based data refresh
- **Data Transformation**: Utilities for formatting raw data for visualization
- **Caching Strategy**: Efficient data caching to minimize API calls
- **Error Recovery**: Retry mechanisms and fallback data sources

## Affected Files

### New Component Files
- `src/components/dashboard/charts/line-chart.tsx` - Line chart component using Recharts
- `src/components/dashboard/charts/bar-chart.tsx` - Bar chart component with customization options
- `src/components/dashboard/charts/pie-chart.tsx` - Pie/doughnut chart component
- `src/components/dashboard/charts/area-chart.tsx` - Area chart for cumulative data
- `src/components/dashboard/kpi-card.tsx` - KPI display card with trend indicators
- `src/components/dashboard/dashboard-grid.tsx` - Main grid layout component
- `src/components/dashboard/chart-container.tsx` - Wrapper component for chart standardization

### Type Definitions
- `src/lib/types/charts.ts` - Chart configuration and data types
- `src/lib/types/kpi.ts` - KPI card data structure types
- `src/lib/types/dashboard.ts` - Dashboard layout and grid types

### Utility Files
- `src/lib/utils/chart-helpers.ts` - Data transformation and formatting utilities
- `src/lib/utils/color-schemes.ts` - Consistent color palettes for charts
- `src/lib/utils/responsive-helpers.ts` - Responsive design utilities

### Styling Files
- `src/styles/charts.css` - Chart-specific styling and overrides
- `src/components/ui/chart.tsx` - Base chart component following Shadcn UI patterns

### Hook Files
- `src/hooks/use-chart-data.ts` - Data fetching and transformation hook
- `src/hooks/use-dashboard-layout.ts` - Grid layout state management hook

### Updated Files
- `src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx` - Integration of new visualization components
- `src/components/common/dashboard-layout.tsx` - Grid system integration
- `package.json` - Addition of charting library dependencies (recharts, date-fns)

## Additional Considerations

### Performance Optimization
- Implement virtualization for large datasets to maintain smooth scrolling
- Use React.memo and useMemo for expensive chart calculations
- Lazy loading for chart components not immediately visible
- Debounced data updates to prevent excessive re-renders

### Accessibility Compliance
- WCAG AA color contrast ratios for all chart elements
- Keyboard navigation support for interactive chart elements
- Screen reader compatible data tables as alternatives to visual charts
- Focus management and proper ARIA labels throughout components

### Scalability & Extensibility
- Plugin architecture for adding new chart types in the future
- Theming system for easy customization of colors and styles
