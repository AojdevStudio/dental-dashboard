# Stagewise Toolbar Integration

Implementation of the stagewise dev-tool to provide AI-powered editing capabilities through a browser toolbar.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Identified project's package manager (pnpm)
- [x] Identified project's frontend framework (Next.js)
- [x] Installed the appropriate stagewise package (`@stagewise/toolbar-next`)
- [x] Located the root layout file for toolbar integration (`src/app/layout.tsx`)
- [x] Created a basic toolbar configuration object
- [x] Implemented the stagewise toolbar in the layout component
- [x] Ensured the toolbar only runs in development mode

## Implementation Plan

The stagewise toolbar has been implemented in the Next.js application to provide AI-powered editing capabilities during development.

### How It Works

1. Stagewise provides a browser toolbar that connects the frontend UI to code AI agents
2. Developers can select elements in the web app, leave comments, and let AI agents make changes
3. The toolbar is only active in development mode and will not be included in production builds

### Relevant Files

- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Root layout component where the stagewise toolbar is integrated
- `package.json` - Updated to include the stagewise package as a dev dependency

### Usage

When running the application in development mode (`pnpm dev`), the stagewise toolbar will appear, allowing developers to:

1. Select UI elements
2. Leave contextual comments
3. Connect with AI agents to make code changes based on those comments
