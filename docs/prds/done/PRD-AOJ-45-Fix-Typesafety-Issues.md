# Product Requirements Document: Fix Typesafety Issues Identified by Biome

## Document Information
- **Issue ID:** AOJ-45
- **Title:** Fix typesafety issues identified by Biome
- **Priority:** High
- **Created:** June 4, 2025
- **Author:** Product Management Team
- **Status:** Draft

## Executive Summary
This PRD outlines the requirements for addressing typesafety issues in the Dental Dashboard codebase that have been identified by Biome. The project aims to improve code quality, reduce the risk of runtime errors, and enhance the developer experience by replacing `any` types with proper TypeScript types and updating Node.js imports to use the node: protocol.

## Background and Strategic Fit
The Dental Dashboard application is built using TypeScript to ensure type safety and improve code quality. However, Biome has identified 149 errors, many related to typesafety issues, particularly the excessive use of `any` types. These issues need to be addressed to maintain code quality standards and prevent potential runtime errors.

### Current State
- Biome check has identified 149 errors in the codebase
- Many files contain instances of `any` type usage
- Node.js imports are not using the recommended node: protocol

### Desired State
- All instances of `any` type replaced with proper TypeScript types
- Node.js imports updated to use the node: protocol
- Biome check passes with no typesafety errors
- No regression in functionality

## Goals and Success Metrics

### Goals
1. Improve code quality and maintainability
2. Enhance developer experience with better IDE support and autocompletion
3. Reduce the risk of runtime errors
4. Ensure consistent use of TypeScript types throughout the codebase

### Success Metrics
1. **Primary:** 100% of `any` types replaced with proper TypeScript types
2. **Primary:** 100% of Node.js imports updated to use the node: protocol
3. **Primary:** Biome check passes with no typesafety errors
4. **Secondary:** No regression in functionality as verified by existing tests

## Detailed Requirements

### 1. Replace `any` Types with Proper Type Definitions

#### 1.1 Files Requiring Updates
The following files have been identified as containing `any` types that need to be replaced:
- `src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/dashboard-client.tsx`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/integrations/google-sheets/test/page.tsx`
- `src/app/api/google/sheets/[spreadsheetId]/test/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/auth/register-comprehensive/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/google-sheets/validate/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/__tests__/api-integration.test.ts` (multiple instances)
- Additional files identified during implementation

#### 1.2 Type Definition Requirements
- Replace all instances of `any` with proper TypeScript types
- Create new type definitions or interfaces as needed
- Use existing type definitions where applicable
- Document complex type definitions with JSDoc comments

#### 1.3 Type Safety Guidelines
- Use union types instead of `any` when multiple types are possible
- Use generics for functions that work with multiple types
- Use the `unknown` type instead of `any` when the type is truly unknown
- Use type guards to narrow types when necessary

### 2. Update Node.js Imports

#### 2.1 Import Protocol Requirements
- Update all Node.js imports to use the node: protocol
- Example: Replace `import crypto from 'crypto'` with `import crypto from 'node:crypto'`

#### 2.2 Affected Modules
- Identify all files with direct Node.js imports
- Update imports in these files to use the node: protocol

### 3. Biome Configuration and Checks

#### 3.1 Biome Configuration
- Ensure Biome is properly configured to check for typesafety issues
- Update Biome configuration if necessary to enforce typesafety rules

#### 3.2 Automated Fixes
- Run Biome check with the `--apply` flag after manual review to automatically fix applicable issues
- Document any issues that cannot be fixed automatically

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Analysis and Low-Risk Files (Day 1)
- Run Biome check to identify all typesafety issues
- Categorize issues by type and file
- Start with test files (`src/app/api/__tests__/api-integration.test.ts`)
- Address development utilities and standalone components

### Phase 2: Node.js Imports (Day 2 - Morning)
- Update Node.js imports to use the node: protocol
- Use Biome's auto-fix capabilities for these changes
- Run Biome check to verify import fixes

### Phase 3: Core Files (Day 2 - Afternoon to Day 3)
- Address `any` types in API routes and utilities
- Fix typesafety issues in core components like `dashboard-client.tsx`
- Run Biome check with the `--apply` flag for applicable issues

### Phase 4: Testing and Verification (Day 3)
- Run existing tests to ensure no regression in functionality
- Run Biome check to verify that all typesafety issues have been resolved
- Conduct code reviews to ensure quality of type definitions

## AI Guardrails Strategy

To ensure safe and manageable implementation, the following AI guardrails will be applied:

### 1. File-Level Constraints
- Process one file per AI session
- Start with test files (lowest risk)
- Save core files like `dashboard-client.tsx` for last
- Implement changes in order of increasing dependency complexity

### 2. Change Type Isolation
- Handle Node.js imports separately (auto-fixable)
- Address `any` types in focused batches
- Don't mix different types of fixes in the same session

### 3. Safety Prompts for AI Sessions
- "Show only type definitions, not implementation changes"
- "Limit to maximum 15 lines of changes per session"
- "Identify files that import from this module before suggesting changes"
- "Perform impact assessment before implementing changes"

### 4. Incremental Validation
- Test each file individually before moving to the next
- Run Biome check after each file
- Verify no regression in functionality
- Focus on leaf nodes first (files that don't export to many others)

## Technical Considerations

### Compatibility
- Ensure that new type definitions are compatible with existing code
- Verify that updated imports do not break existing functionality

### Performance
- Monitor build time to ensure that additional type checking does not significantly impact performance

### Maintainability
- Document complex type definitions to improve maintainability
- Follow TypeScript best practices to ensure code is easy to understand and maintain

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Introducing new bugs while fixing typesafety issues | High | Medium | Comprehensive testing and code reviews |
| Breaking changes in external dependencies | Medium | Low | Verify compatibility with external dependencies |
| Increased build time due to additional type checking | Medium | Low | Monitor build performance and optimize if necessary |
| Incomplete type coverage | Medium | Medium | Use TypeScript's `--strict` flag to identify missing types |

## Dependencies

- TypeScript compiler
- Biome linter and formatter
- Existing test suite

## Timeline and Milestones

| Milestone | Description | Estimated Completion |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| Analysis & Test Files | All typesafety issues identified and categorized; test files fixed | Day 1 |
| API Routes & Utilities | Fix typesafety in API routes and utilities; Update Node.js imports | Day 2 |
| Core Components & Validation | Fix typesafety in core components; Final validation | Day 3 |

This timeline aligns with fast-shipping team standards (2-3 days for high priority issues).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All instances of `any` type replaced with proper TypeScript types
- [ ] Node.js imports updated to use the node: protocol
- [ ] Biome check passes with no typesafety errors
- [ ] No regression in functionality as verified by existing tests
- [ ] Code review completed and approved

## Future Considerations

- Implement stricter TypeScript configuration to prevent the introduction of new `any` types
- Add pre-commit hooks to run Biome check and prevent typesafety issues from being committed
- Consider adding additional static analysis tools to further improve code quality
