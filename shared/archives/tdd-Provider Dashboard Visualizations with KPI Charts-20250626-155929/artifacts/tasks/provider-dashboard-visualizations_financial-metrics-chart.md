# Task: Financial Metrics Chart Component

## Description
Implement an interactive financial metrics chart component that visualizes provider financial KPIs including production totals, collection rates, and overhead percentages. This component provides drill-down capabilities and responsive chart rendering.

## Dependencies
- Provider metrics calculation system (provider-dashboard-visualizations_metrics-calculation-system)
- KPI dashboard container (provider-dashboard-visualizations_kpi-dashboard-container)
- Recharts library integration (exists)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Financial KPIs display: production totals, collection rates, overhead percentages
- [ ] Multiple chart types supported: bar charts for comparisons, line charts for trends
- [ ] Interactive tooltips show detailed financial breakdowns
- [ ] Responsive design adapts to different screen sizes
- [ ] Loading states display while financial data is being fetched
- [ ] Error handling for missing or invalid financial data
- [ ] Chart animations are smooth and professional
- [ ] Accessibility features support screen readers

## Technical Requirements
- Create `src/components/dashboard/charts/financial-metrics-chart.tsx`
- Use Recharts library for chart rendering
- Implement TypeScript interfaces for financial data props
- Support multiple chart types (Bar, Line, Area charts)
- Add interactive tooltips with formatted financial values
- Use responsive chart containers with proper scaling
- Implement proper loading and error states
- Add ARIA labels and accessibility features

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Financial charts render accurately with real data
- [ ] Interactive features (tooltips, hover effects) work properly
- [ ] Responsive design functions across all device sizes
- [ ] Loading and error states provide clear user feedback
- [ ] Chart performance meets <1 second render requirement
- [ ] Component follows TypeScript strict mode guidelines
- [ ] Unit tests validate chart rendering and interactions

## Test Scenarios
**Chart Rendering:**
- Financial data displays accurately in chart format
- Multiple data series render correctly
- Chart scaling adapts to data ranges appropriately
- Color schemes are accessible and professional
- Chart legends are clear and informative

**Interactivity:**
- Tooltips display on hover with correct financial values
- Chart animations are smooth and non-disruptive
- Responsive resize maintains chart readability
- Touch interactions work on mobile devices
- Keyboard navigation is supported for accessibility

**Data Handling:**
- Empty data sets display appropriate messages
- Missing financial data handles gracefully
- Large datasets render efficiently
- Data updates reflect immediately in chart
- Invalid data values are filtered or highlighted

**Performance:**
- Chart renders within 1-second target
- Smooth animations don't impact performance
- Memory usage is optimized for chart data
- Responsive updates are efficient

## Implementation Notes
- Use Recharts ResponsiveContainer for responsive design
- Implement custom tooltip components for rich financial data display
- Format financial values with proper currency symbols and decimals
- Use consistent color palette matching dashboard theme
- Consider implementing chart export functionality
- Add proper error boundaries specific to chart rendering
- Optimize chart re-rendering when data updates
- Design charts to handle various financial data scenarios

## Potential Gotchas
- Financial value formatting and currency display
- Chart responsiveness across different screen sizes
- Recharts performance with large financial datasets
- Tooltip positioning and overflow handling
- Color accessibility for financial data visualization
- Chart animation performance on lower-end devices
- Data precision and rounding in financial calculations
- Integration with existing dashboard themes and styles
