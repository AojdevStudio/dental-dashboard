# Task: Create E2E Test Utilities and Helpers

## Description
Develop comprehensive test utilities and helper functions for Playwright MCP E2E testing. This includes authentication helpers, data seeding utilities, common page interactions, and Server Component testing patterns.

## Dependencies
- test-suite-modernization_playwright-mcp-setup.md

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create `tests/e2e/utils.ts` with core testing utilities
- [ ] Implement authentication helper for test user login
- [ ] Create data seeding utilities for test scenarios
- [ ] Develop Server Component testing patterns
- [ ] Add common page interaction helpers
- [ ] Include test cleanup utilities

## Technical Requirements
- Implementation approach: Modular utility functions with TypeScript
- Performance constraints: Utility functions should be optimized for reuse
- Security considerations: Secure handling of test authentication tokens

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Unit tests written for utility functions
- [ ] TypeScript types properly defined
- [ ] Utilities successfully used in example test
- [ ] Documentation comments for all exported functions

## Test Scenarios
Detailed scenarios that Test Writer should cover:
- Authentication flow testing utilities
- Multi-tenant data isolation helpers
- Server Component async data loading patterns
- Test data cleanup after each test
- Browser state management between tests

## Implementation Notes
- Create reusable functions for common test operations
- Implement proper TypeScript types for all utilities
- Use async/await patterns consistently
- Include error handling for robustness
- Follow DRY principle for test code
- Consider creating custom test fixtures
