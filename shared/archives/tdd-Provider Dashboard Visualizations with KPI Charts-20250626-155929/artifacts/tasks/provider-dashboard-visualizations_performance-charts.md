# Task: Performance Metrics Charts Component

## Description
Create interactive performance metrics chart components that visualize provider performance KPIs including goal achievement, variance analysis, and trend calculations. This includes line charts for trends and gauge charts for goal achievement percentages.

## Dependencies
- Provider metrics calculation system (provider-dashboard-visualizations_metrics-calculation-system)
- KPI dashboard container (provider-dashboard-visualizations_kpi-dashboard-container)
- Financial metrics chart component (provider-dashboard-visualizations_financial-metrics-chart)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Line charts display production trends and goal progress over time
- [ ] Gauge charts show goal achievement percentages and performance ratings
- [ ] Variance analysis charts highlight performance gaps
- [ ] Interactive tooltips provide detailed performance breakdowns
- [ ] Charts support multiple time period views (monthly, quarterly, yearly)
- [ ] Responsive design maintains readability across all screen sizes
- [ ] Loading states display while performance data is calculated
- [ ] Performance benchmarks and targets are clearly indicated

## Technical Requirements
- Create `src/components/dashboard/charts/provider-performance-chart.tsx`
- Implement `src/components/dashboard/charts/goal-progress-chart.tsx`
- Use Recharts for line charts and consider custom gauge implementation
- Support time-series data visualization with proper date formatting
- Add interactive zoom and pan features for trend analysis
- Implement performance threshold indicators and target lines
- Use consistent styling with other dashboard components
- Add proper TypeScript interfaces for performance data

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Performance charts accurately reflect calculated metrics
- [ ] Goal achievement visualizations are intuitive and clear
- [ ] Interactive features enhance data exploration
- [ ] Charts render within <1 second performance target
- [ ] Responsive design works across all device sizes
- [ ] Error handling manages missing performance data gracefully
- [ ] Component integration with dashboard container is seamless

## Test Scenarios
**Chart Accuracy:**
- Goal achievement percentages match calculated values
- Trend lines accurately represent performance over time
- Variance indicators show correct performance gaps
- Benchmark comparisons are visually clear
- Time period filtering works correctly

**User Interaction:**
- Time period selectors update charts appropriately
- Zoom and pan features work smoothly
- Tooltips provide meaningful performance insights
- Mobile touch interactions are responsive
- Keyboard navigation supports accessibility

**Performance Visualization:**
- Goal achievement gauges display current status clearly
- Trend charts show performance patterns effectively
- Variance analysis highlights important deviations
- Performance targets and thresholds are visible
- Multiple metrics can be compared simultaneously

**Edge Cases:**
- Charts handle periods with no performance data
- Extreme values don't break chart scaling
- Goal changes over time are represented accurately
- Missing data points are handled gracefully

## Implementation Notes
- Design gauge charts for clear goal achievement visualization
- Implement time period selectors for trend analysis
- Use performance color coding (green for meeting goals, red for below target)
- Add performance benchmark lines and target indicators
- Consider implementing chart export and sharing features
- Optimize chart rendering for smooth interactions
- Use consistent date formatting across all time-based charts
- Implement proper loading skeletons for complex calculations

## Potential Gotchas
- Time-series data handling and date formatting complexity
- Gauge chart implementation with Recharts or custom solutions
- Performance calculation accuracy over different time periods
- Chart scaling with varying performance ranges
- Interactive features performance on mobile devices
- Color accessibility for performance status indicators
- Memory management with large time-series datasets
- Integration of multiple chart types in single component
