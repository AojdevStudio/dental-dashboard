# Task: Comparative Analytics Table Component

## Description
Create a comprehensive comparative analytics table component that displays provider rankings, clinic averages, and benchmark comparisons. This component provides tabular data visualization with sorting, filtering, and comparative insights across multiple KPI dimensions.

## Dependencies
- Provider metrics calculation system (provider-dashboard-visualizations_metrics-calculation-system)
- All chart components for consistent data sourcing
- KPI dashboard container (provider-dashboard-visualizations_kpi-dashboard-container)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Provider ranking table shows performance across all KPI categories
- [ ] Clinic average comparisons highlight above/below average performance
- [ ] Benchmark comparisons show industry or historical standards
- [ ] Interactive sorting capabilities for all metric columns
- [ ] Filtering options for time periods and metric categories
- [ ] Visual indicators for performance trends (up/down arrows, color coding)
- [ ] Export functionality for comparative reports
- [ ] Responsive table design for mobile and tablet viewing

## Technical Requirements
- Create `src/components/dashboard/provider-comparison-table.tsx`
- Use shadcn/ui Table components for consistent styling
- Implement sortable columns with proper TypeScript typing
- Add filtering capabilities with date range and category selectors
- Include visual performance indicators and trend arrows
- Add export functionality (CSV, PDF) for comparison reports
- Implement responsive table design with horizontal scrolling
- Use proper accessibility features for table navigation

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Comparative table displays accurate provider rankings
- [ ] Sorting and filtering functionality works correctly
- [ ] Visual indicators effectively communicate performance trends
- [ ] Export features generate proper reports
- [ ] Responsive design maintains usability on all devices
- [ ] Table performance handles large datasets efficiently
- [ ] Component follows accessibility guidelines

## Test Scenarios
**Data Accuracy:**
- Provider rankings reflect calculated performance metrics
- Clinic averages are computed correctly
- Benchmark comparisons use appropriate baseline data
- Performance trends show accurate directional changes
- Filtered data maintains calculation accuracy

**User Interaction:**
- Column sorting works for all metric types
- Multiple sort criteria can be applied
- Filtering updates table data appropriately
- Export functionality generates correct reports
- Mobile table scrolling and interaction work smoothly

**Performance:**
- Table renders quickly with large provider datasets
- Sorting operations are responsive
- Filtering doesn't cause significant delays
- Export functionality completes efficiently
- Mobile performance remains smooth

**Accessibility:**
- Screen readers can navigate table structure
- Keyboard navigation works for all interactive elements
- Sort indicators are accessible
- Visual performance indicators have text alternatives

## Implementation Notes
- Design table headers with clear metric descriptions
- Implement performance color coding (green/yellow/red system)
- Add trend arrows and percentage change indicators
- Use proper number formatting for different metric types
- Consider implementing row highlighting for current provider
- Add table pagination or virtualization for large datasets
- Design mobile-friendly responsive table layout
- Include proper loading states for table data

## Potential Gotchas
- Table responsive design complexity with many columns
- Performance optimization with large provider datasets
- Sorting algorithm efficiency for different data types
- Export functionality formatting and data accuracy
- Mobile horizontal scrolling user experience
- Accessibility compliance with complex table interactions
- Memory usage with comprehensive comparative data
- Integration with existing table component patterns
