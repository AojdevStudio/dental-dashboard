# Task: Set Up Playwright MCP Configuration

## Description
Create the foundational Playwright MCP configuration files and integration setup to enable browser-based testing for Server Components. This includes setting up the base configuration, MCP-specific settings, and basic test infrastructure.

## Dependencies
- No dependencies (foundation task)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create `playwright.config.ts` with MCP integration enabled
- [ ] Configure test directories and project structure
- [ ] Set up base URL and environment variable handling
- [ ] Enable MCP-specific features (AI-assisted testing, self-healing)
- [ ] Configure browser launch options and timeout settings
- [ ] Create basic test example to validate setup

## Technical Requirements
- Implementation approach: Create new configuration file following Playwright best practices
- Performance constraints: Browser startup time < 3 seconds
- Security considerations: Secure handling of test environment variables

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Configuration file validates without errors
- [ ] Basic test can launch browser and navigate to application
- [ ] No conflicts with existing Vitest configuration
- [ ] Documentation comments added to configuration

## Test Scenarios
Detailed scenarios that Test Writer should cover:
- Happy path: Browser launches and connects to test application
- Edge case: Configuration handles missing environment variables gracefully
- Error condition: Clear error messages when browser fails to launch
- Performance test: Measure browser startup and connection time

## Implementation Notes
- Use TypeScript for configuration file
- Follow Playwright MCP documentation for proper setup
- Include project separation for different test types
- Configure reporter for test results
- Set up screenshot and video capture on failure
- Maximum file size: ~100 lines of configuration
