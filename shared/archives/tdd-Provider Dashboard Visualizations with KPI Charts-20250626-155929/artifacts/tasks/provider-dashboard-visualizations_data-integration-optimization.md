# Task: Data Integration and Performance Optimization

## Description
Integrate all dashboard components with real database data and implement comprehensive caching strategies to meet the <2 second load time requirement. This includes optimizing database queries, implementing efficient caching, and ensuring optimal performance across all visualizations.

## Dependencies
- All chart components (financial, performance, patient analytics, comparative table)
- Provider metrics calculation system (provider-dashboard-visualizations_metrics-calculation-system)
- KPI dashboard container (provider-dashboard-visualizations_kpi-dashboard-container)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Real-time data updates reflect in all dashboard visualizations
- [ ] Page load times consistently under 2 seconds with full data
- [ ] Chart rendering times under 1 second for complex visualizations
- [ ] Caching strategies reduce redundant database queries significantly
- [ ] Database query optimization maintains accuracy while improving speed
- [ ] Error handling works properly across all data integration points
- [ ] No performance degradation to existing provider listing functionality
- [ ] Progressive loading provides immediate user feedback

## Technical Requirements
- Integrate all dashboard components with real Supabase/Prisma database data
- Implement multi-level caching: in-memory, Redis/browser storage, and database-level
- Optimize database queries using EXPLAIN ANALYZE for performance validation
- Add progressive loading with skeleton states for complex calculations
- Implement efficient data refresh strategies without full page reloads
- Use React.Suspense and error boundaries for optimal user experience
- Add performance monitoring and logging for bottleneck identification
- Implement database connection pooling and query optimization

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Dashboard loads complete provider data within 2-second target
- [ ] All chart components render within 1-second target
- [ ] Caching reduces database load by at least 70%
- [ ] Database queries are optimized and performant
- [ ] Error handling provides graceful degradation
- [ ] Performance monitoring tools are in place
- [ ] Integration tests validate end-to-end performance

## Test Scenarios
**Performance Validation:**
- Page load times measured under 2 seconds consistently
- Chart rendering times measured under 1 second
- Database query execution times are optimized
- Caching effectiveness reduces redundant queries
- Memory usage remains within acceptable limits

**Data Integration:**
- Real provider data displays accurately across all components
- Data updates propagate correctly to all visualizations
- Multi-tenant security maintains data isolation
- RLS policies don't impact performance significantly
- Concurrent user access doesn't degrade performance

**Error Handling:**
- Network failures handle gracefully with user feedback
- Database timeouts provide appropriate error messages
- Partial data loads don't break dashboard functionality
- Cache invalidation works correctly when data changes
- Component errors don't cascade to other dashboard parts

**User Experience:**
- Progressive loading provides immediate visual feedback
- Interactive features remain responsive during data loading
- Error states provide clear guidance for resolution
- Refresh functionality works without full page reloads

## Implementation Notes
- Implement database query optimization with proper indexing
- Use TanStack Query for sophisticated caching strategies
- Add Redis or browser storage for persistent caching
- Implement skeleton loading states for better perceived performance
- Use React.Suspense boundaries strategically for progressive loading
- Add performance monitoring with timing logs
- Consider implementing service worker for offline data caching
- Design caching invalidation strategies for data freshness

## Potential Gotchas
- Complex caching invalidation when provider data changes
- Database query optimization without losing multi-tenant security
- Memory management with large cached datasets
- Concurrent user access impacting cache performance
- Progressive loading implementation complexity
- Error boundary placement and recovery strategies
- Performance monitoring overhead
- Cache consistency across multiple dashboard components
- RLS policy performance impact on complex queries
