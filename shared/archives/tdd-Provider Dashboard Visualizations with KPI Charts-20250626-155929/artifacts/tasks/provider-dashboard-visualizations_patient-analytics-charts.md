# Task: Patient Analytics Charts Component

## Description
Develop interactive patient analytics chart components that visualize patient-related KPIs including patient count, appointment efficiency, case acceptance rates, and procedure type distribution. This includes pie charts for distribution analysis and bar charts for appointment metrics.

## Dependencies
- Provider metrics calculation system (provider-dashboard-visualizations_metrics-calculation-system)
- KPI dashboard container (provider-dashboard-visualizations_kpi-dashboard-container)
- Performance metrics charts (provider-dashboard-visualizations_performance-charts)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Patient count metrics display with trend analysis over time
- [ ] Appointment efficiency charts show scheduling and completion rates
- [ ] Case acceptance rate visualizations track patient treatment acceptance
- [ ] Pie charts display procedure type distribution and revenue breakdown
- [ ] Patient demographic analytics provide insights into patient base
- [ ] Interactive drill-down capabilities for detailed patient data
- [ ] Comparative analytics show patient metrics vs clinic averages
- [ ] Charts support filtering by date ranges and patient categories

## Technical Requirements
- Create `src/components/dashboard/charts/patient-analytics-chart.tsx`
- Implement pie charts for procedure type and demographic distribution
- Build bar charts for appointment efficiency and acceptance rates
- Add patient count trend visualization with line charts
- Use Recharts library with custom styling for patient data
- Implement interactive legends and data point selection
- Add proper TypeScript interfaces for patient analytics data
- Include accessibility features for screen readers

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Patient analytics charts display accurate calculated data
- [ ] Pie charts effectively show distribution breakdowns
- [ ] Interactive features enable detailed data exploration
- [ ] Charts maintain performance standards (<1 second render)
- [ ] Responsive design works across all screen sizes
- [ ] Error handling manages missing patient data appropriately
- [ ] Component follows established dashboard patterns

## Test Scenarios
**Data Visualization:**
- Patient count trends accurately reflect database records
- Appointment efficiency metrics match scheduling data
- Case acceptance rates calculate correctly
- Procedure distribution percentages are accurate
- Demographic breakdowns represent patient base correctly

**Chart Interactivity:**
- Pie chart segments highlight on hover with details
- Bar chart interactions provide additional insights
- Date range filtering updates patient metrics appropriately
- Drill-down features navigate to detailed patient views
- Comparative analytics toggle between individual and clinic data

**Responsive Design:**
- Pie charts remain readable on small screens
- Bar chart labels adapt to available space
- Chart legends reposition for mobile layouts
- Touch interactions work smoothly on tablets
- Print layouts are optimized for reports

**Data Edge Cases:**
- Empty patient data displays helpful messages
- Single procedure types handle edge cases gracefully
- Large patient datasets render efficiently
- Missing demographic data doesn't break charts

## Implementation Notes
- Design pie charts for clear procedure type visualization
- Implement custom tooltip components for patient data details
- Use consistent color schemes for patient demographic categories
- Add patient privacy considerations to data display
- Consider implementing patient anonymization for sensitive data
- Optimize chart performance for large patient datasets
- Design charts to support future patient analytics expansion
- Add proper loading states for complex patient calculations

## Potential Gotchas
- Patient data privacy and anonymization requirements
- Large patient datasets impacting chart performance
- Pie chart readability with many procedure types
- Date range complexity with patient visit patterns
- Responsive design challenges with detailed patient charts
- Color accessibility for demographic and procedure categories
- Memory usage with comprehensive patient analytics
- Integration with existing patient data security policies
