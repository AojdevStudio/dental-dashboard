# Task: Configure Test Database and Data Management

## Description
Set up isolated test databases for E2E tests with proper data seeding, cleanup procedures, and multi-tenant test scenarios. This ensures Playwright MCP tests have reliable test data without interfering with development or other test runs.

## Dependencies
- test-suite-modernization_e2e-test-utilities.md

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Configure separate test database for E2E tests
- [ ] Implement test data seeding scripts
- [ ] Create cleanup procedures for test isolation
- [ ] Set up multi-tenant test scenarios
- [ ] Configure RLS policies for test database
- [ ] Document test data management procedures

## Technical Requirements
- Implementation approach: Database-per-test-run or transaction rollback
- Performance constraints: Fast database setup and teardown
- Security considerations: Proper RLS policy testing

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Test database setup automated
- [ ] Data isolation verified
- [ ] Cleanup procedures tested
- [ ] Documentation complete

## Test Scenarios
Detailed scenarios that Test Writer should cover:
- Multi-tenant data isolation validation
- RLS policy enforcement in tests
- Test data consistency
- Cleanup verification
- Concurrent test execution safety

## Implementation Notes
- Use Prisma for test data management
- Implement transaction-based test isolation where possible
- Create factory functions for test data
- Include AOJ-65 RLS validation scenarios
- Consider using database snapshots for speed
- Document connection string management
