**Generated**: Thu Jun 26 10:29:38 CDT 2025
**Framework**: vitest
**Command**: node scripts/test-runner.js run

## Test Framework Setup
- Primary framework: vitest
- Test command: node scripts/test-runner.js run
- Test file pattern: **/*.{test,spec}.{js,ts}
- Test directory: ./tests

## Coverage Strategy
- Unit tests for each acceptance criterion
- Integration tests for component interactions  
- Edge case tests for error conditions
- Performance tests where specified in tasks

## Test Organization
- One test file per task (when appropriate)
- Grouped test suites for related functionality
- Clear test naming for traceability to acceptance criteria

## Mocking Strategy
- External dependencies to mock: TBD (analyze during test creation)
- Internal components to isolate: TBD
- Data setup requirements: TBD

## MCP Tool Integration
- zen!testgen: For comprehensive test generation with edge cases
- context7: For up-to-date vitest testing patterns and best practices

## Red Phase Verification
- All tests must fail initially (RED phase of TDD)
- Failure reasons should be clear and actionable
- Test command: node scripts/test-runner.js run
