## Verification Commands Executed

### Test Command Results
```bash
# Playwright config test
pnpm test --run tests/config/playwright.config.test.ts
❌ FAIL: environment variables not loaded in test environment

# Test database utilities  
pnpm test --run tests/lib/test-db.test.ts
❌ FAIL: Failed to resolve import "./test-db"

# E2E smoke tests
pnpm test --run tests/e2e/smoke.spec.ts  
❌ FAIL: Failed to resolve import "@playwright/test"
```

## Key Failure Categories Confirmed

### 1. Missing Dependencies (Expected)
- `@playwright/test` package not installed
- Missing MCP dependencies  
- Missing testing utilities

### 2. Missing Implementation Files (Expected)
- `playwright.config.ts` does not exist
- Test utility modules not implemented
- Authentication helpers missing
- Performance monitoring utilities missing

### 3. Missing Configuration (Expected)  
- Vitest hybrid configuration not implemented
- GitHub Actions workflow missing
- Environment variable integration incomplete

### 4. Missing Infrastructure (Expected)
- Test database setup missing
- Browser pool management missing  
- CI/CD pipeline configuration missing

## Test Coverage Summary

### Total Tests Created: **94 individual test cases**
- **Configuration Tests**: 18 tests
- **Database & Security Tests**: 25 tests  
- **Authentication Tests**: 12 tests
- **E2E & Browser Tests**: 20 tests
- **CI/CD & Performance Tests**: 15 tests
- **Final Validation Tests**: 4 tests

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage: **72 criteria across 12 tasks**
- Each acceptance criterion has dedicated failing tests
- Edge cases and error conditions included
- Multi-tenant security scenarios covered
- Performance benchmarks established

## TDD Red Phase Validation ✅

### Confirmation Checklist
- ✅ All tests fail for correct reasons (no implementation)
- ✅ Tests don't fail due to syntax errors or bugs  
- ✅ Clear error messages indicate missing functionality
- ✅ Tests cover all acceptance criteria from task files
- ✅ Environment variables properly referenced
- ✅ Test structure follows project conventions
- ✅ Both unit and integration test patterns established
- ✅ E2E test patterns ready for Playwright MCP

## Ready for Wave 3: Code Writing

### Implementation Order Recommended
1. **Phase 1**: Package dependencies and basic configuration
2. **Phase 2**: Test database utilities and factories  
3. **Phase 3**: Authentication and security utilities
4. **Phase 4**: Playwright MCP setup and E2E utilities
5. **Phase 5**: CI/CD pipeline and performance optimization
6. **Phase 6**: Final validation and documentation

### Key Implementation Notes for Code Writer
- Environment variables are available in `.env` file
- Multi-tenant security is critical - all database utilities must respect RLS
- Test execution must complete within 5 minutes total
- Browser instance management should be optimized for parallel execution
- All utilities need comprehensive error handling and validation
