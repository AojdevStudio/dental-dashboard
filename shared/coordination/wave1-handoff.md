# Wave 1 Handoff: Task Planning Complete

## Summary

Wave 1 Task Planning has been successfully completed for AOJ-59: Comprehensive Test Suite Modernization. The PRD has been analyzed and decomposed into 12 atomic implementation tasks with clear dependencies and execution order.

## Tasks Created

1. **test-suite-modernization_playwright-mcp-setup.md** - Foundation Playwright MCP configuration
2. **test-suite-modernization_e2e-test-utilities.md** - E2E test utilities and helpers
3. **test-suite-modernization_package-dependencies.md** - Package.json updates for Playwright
4. **test-suite-modernization_test-categorization-audit.md** - Audit and categorize failing tests
5. **test-suite-modernization_test-database-setup.md** - Configure test database management
6. **test-suite-modernization_migrate-server-component-tests.md** - Migrate Server Components to E2E
7. **test-suite-modernization_vitest-config-update.md** - Update Vitest for hybrid approach
8. **test-suite-modernization_rls-security-validation.md** - RLS security validation tests
9. **test-suite-modernization_ci-cd-pipeline-update.md** - CI/CD pipeline hybrid support
10. **test-suite-modernization_performance-optimization.md** - Optimize test execution time
11. **test-suite-modernization_documentation-update.md** - Comprehensive testing documentation
12. **test-suite-modernization_final-validation.md** - Final validation and rollback capability

## Key Insights for Test Writer

### Testing Strategy
- **Hybrid Approach**: Use Playwright MCP for async Server Components, maintain Vitest for sync components
- **Current State**: 52% test pass rate (115/220 failing) due to Server Component incompatibility
- **Target**: 95%+ test pass rate with <5 minute execution time

### Critical Dependencies
1. Start with Playwright MCP setup before any test migration
2. Test categorization audit is essential before migration
3. Vitest config and CI/CD updates are high-risk and should be done carefully

### Recommended Test Approaches

#### For Server Components (Playwright MCP)
- Focus on E2E browser testing
- Test async data fetching and SSR
- Validate multi-tenant data isolation
- Use accessibility snapshots for stability

#### For Client Components (Vitest)
- Continue using existing unit test patterns
- Focus on component logic and state
- Use React Testing Library patterns
- Maintain fast execution times

#### For Security (RLS Validation)
- Comprehensive multi-tenant scenarios
- Test unauthorized access attempts
- Validate data isolation between clinics
- Critical for AOJ-65 implementation validation

### MCP Recommendations for Next Wave

1. **Use Playwright MCP** for browser automation and E2E test writing
2. **Consider zen tool** for complex test generation and code review
3. **Use context7** for testing best practices and documentation lookup
4. **Linear integration** for tracking test coverage progress

### Risk Mitigation
- High-risk files: vitest.config.ts, CI/CD workflows
- Implement changes incrementally (1-2 files per session)
- Test each change thoroughly before proceeding
- Maintain rollback capability at each phase

## Next Steps for Wave 2

1. Start with creating example tests using the task specifications
2. Focus on happy path scenarios first
3. Build comprehensive test coverage for each task
4. Ensure tests align with acceptance criteria
5. Validate AI guardrails are followed (max 15-20 lines per change)
