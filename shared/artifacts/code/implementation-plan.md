# Implementation Plan

## Current State
- Total failing tests: 167 (90 failed | 77 passed)
- Test categories: unit/integration/e2e mixed
- Implementation order: Following 6-phase dependency order from Wave 1
- Key issues: Missing dependencies (@playwright/test), missing DB utilities, missing auth helpers

## Implementation Strategy
1. Start with foundation tasks (Phase 1: Playwright MCP setup, utilities, dependencies)
2. Implement minimal code to pass tests (follow TDD GREEN phase)
3. Refactor for quality after green phase using zen MCP review
4. Verify integration points continuously

## File Creation Plan

### New files to create:
- `playwright.config.ts` - Main Playwright configuration with MCP integration
- `tests/utils/playwright-auth.ts` - Authentication helpers for E2E tests
- `tests/utils/test-db.ts` - Multi-tenant test database utilities
- `tests/utils/factories.ts` - Test data factory utilities
- `tests/setup/global-setup.ts` - Global test setup
- `tests/setup/global-teardown.ts` - Global test cleanup
- `.github/workflows/test-hybrid.yml` - CI/CD workflow for hybrid testing
- `tests/performance/monitoring.ts` - Performance monitoring utilities

### Existing files to modify:
- `package.json` - Add Playwright and other missing dependencies
- `vitest.config.ts` - Update for hybrid configuration
- `src/lib/database/prisma.ts` - Ensure exists for test imports

### Dependencies to install:
- `@playwright/test` - Core Playwright testing framework
- `msw` - Mock Service Worker for API mocking
- `@faker-js/faker` - Test data generation
- Performance monitoring libraries (TBD based on test requirements)

## Risk Areas
- Complex integration points: Multi-tenant database setup with RLS
- Performance requirements: 5-minute total execution time constraint
- Security considerations: Row-Level Security enforcement in test utilities
- Browser management: Efficient instance pooling for parallel E2E tests

## Phase-by-Phase Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Foundation (No Dependencies)
1. **Package Dependencies** - Install @playwright/test, msw, etc.
2. **Playwright MCP Setup** - Create playwright.config.ts with MCP integration
3. **E2E Test Utilities** - Create basic auth helpers and test utilities

### Phase 2: Analysis and Preparation
4. **Test Categorization Audit** - Audit and organize failing tests
5. **Test Database Setup** - Create multi-tenant test database utilities

### Phase 3: Core Migration
6. **Server Component Tests Migration** - Move to Playwright MCP

### Phase 4: Configuration Updates
7. **Vitest Config Update** - Hybrid unit/integration configuration
8. **RLS Security Validation** - Multi-tenant security test utilities

### Phase 5: CI/CD Integration
9. **CI/CD Pipeline Update** - GitHub Actions workflow
10. **Performance Optimization** - Monitoring and optimization utilities

### Phase 6: Documentation and Validation
11. **Documentation Update** - Update test documentation
12. **Final Validation** - End-to-end system validation

## MCP Tool Integration Strategy

### Zen MCP Usage
- **Code Review**: Validate complex RLS and security implementations
- **Debug**: Troubleshoot multi-tenant database issues
- **Think Deep**: Architectural decisions around test infrastructure

### Context7 MCP Usage
- **Framework Documentation**: Get latest Playwright MCP integration patterns
- **Best Practices**: Ensure test utilities follow current standards
- **API References**: Validate database connection and auth patterns

## Success Criteria
- All 167 tests passing (95%+ pass rate target)
- Total execution time under 5 minutes
- Multi-tenant security enforced in all test utilities
- No regressions in existing functionality
- Comprehensive error handling and graceful failure handling
