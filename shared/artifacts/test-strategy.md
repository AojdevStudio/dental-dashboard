# Test Strategy for AOJ-59: Test Suite Modernization

## Executive Summary
This strategy outlines the comprehensive test writing approach for the Test Suite Modernization project, focusing on creating failing tests for hybrid Playwright MCP + Vitest implementation.

## Test Framework Setup
- **Primary Framework**: Vitest (current environment)
- **Secondary Framework**: Playwright MCP (to be implemented)
- **Test File Locations**: 
  - Unit tests: `src/{component}/__tests__/`
  - Integration tests: `src/{component}/__tests__/integration/`
  - E2E tests: `src/{component}/__tests__/e2e/`
- **Naming Conventions**: `{component}.test.ts`, `{feature}.integration.test.ts`, `{feature}.e2e.test.ts`

## Coverage Strategy

### Unit Tests (Vitest)
- Each acceptance criterion gets dedicated test cases
- Focus on pure functions and isolated components
- Mock external dependencies and async operations
- Target 90%+ line coverage for utilities

### Integration Tests (Vitest)
- Test component interactions with real dependencies
- Database operations with test database
- API route testing with authentication
- Multi-tenant security validation

### E2E Tests (Playwright MCP)
- Server Component rendering and async operations
- Full user workflows from authentication to data display
- Browser compatibility and accessibility
- Performance benchmarks

## Test Organization

### Test Structure Pattern
```
describe('Feature/Component', () => {
  // Setup and teardown
  beforeEach(() => { /* test setup */ });
  afterEach(() => { /* test cleanup */ });

  // Tests grouped by acceptance criteria
  describe('Acceptance Criterion 1', () => {
    it('should handle happy path scenario', () => { /* test */ });
    it('should handle edge case scenario', () => { /* test */ });
  });

  describe('Error Handling', () => {
    it('should throw appropriate error for invalid input', () => { /* test */ });
  });
});
```

### File Organization by Task
- **Phase 1 Tasks**: Foundation setup tests
- **Phase 2 Tasks**: Analysis and audit tests  
- **Phase 3 Tasks**: Migration validation tests
- **Phase 4 Tasks**: Configuration and security tests
- **Phase 5 Tasks**: CI/CD and performance tests
- **Phase 6 Tasks**: Documentation and final validation tests

## Mocking Strategy

### External Dependencies to Mock
- Supabase client connections
- Google Sheets API calls
- Authentication providers
- Third-party APIs

### Internal Components to Isolate
- Database queries (unit tests)
- Server Components (for Vitest tests)
- Complex UI components
- File system operations

### Data Setup Requirements
- Test database with seeded data
- Mock user sessions
- Multi-tenant test data isolation
- RLS policy validation scenarios

## Enhanced Test Generation with MCP Tools

### Zen MCP Integration
- **AI-Powered Test Generation**: Use `zen!thinkdeep` for complex test scenarios
- **Edge Case Discovery**: Leverage different AI models for comprehensive coverage
- **Code Review**: Use `zen!codereview` for test quality validation
- **Test Strategy Validation**: Use `zen!chat` for collaborative planning

### Context7 MCP Integration
- **Framework Documentation**: Get up-to-date Vitest/Playwright patterns
- **Best Practices**: Access current testing methodologies
- **API References**: Ensure test methods are current and optimal

## Quality Assurance

### RED Phase Requirements
- All tests MUST fail initially (TDD approach)
- Tests should fail for correct reasons (no implementation)
- Clear error messages indicating missing functionality
- Verification through `pnpm test` execution

### Test Quality Standards
- Clear, descriptive test names
- Proper setup and teardown
- Isolated test cases (no interdependencies)
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Performance considerations

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
- Server Component testing (async operations)
- Multi-tenant data isolation
- Authentication flows
- Database migrations
- CI/CD pipeline integration

### Testing Constraints
- Maximum 15-20 lines per test modification
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Test execution under 5 minutes
- Phased implementation approach

## Success Metrics

### Coverage Targets
- 95%+ test pass rate after implementation
- 80%+ code coverage maintained
- Zero false negative failures in CI/CD
- All acceptance criteria tested

### Quality Indicators
- Tests clearly map to acceptance criteria
- Edge cases and error conditions covered
- Performance benchmarks established
- Security validation comprehensive

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Tests
- Playwright MCP setup validation
- E2E test utilities functionality
- Package dependency verification

### Phase 2: Analysis Tests
- Test categorization audit validation
- Test database setup verification

### Phase 3: Migration Tests
- Server Component migration validation
- Async operation testing

### Phase 4: Configuration Tests
- Vitest configuration validation
- RLS security policy testing

### Phase 5: CI/CD Tests
- Pipeline integration validation
- Performance optimization verification

### Phase 6: Final Validation Tests
- Documentation completeness
- End-to-end system validation
- Rollback capability testing

This comprehensive strategy ensures systematic test creation that validates every aspect of the modernization effort while maintaining TDD principles through the RED phase approach.
