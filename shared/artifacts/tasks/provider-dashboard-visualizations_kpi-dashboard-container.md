# Task: KPI Dashboard Container Component

## Description
Create the main container component that orchestrates the provider KPI dashboard, including layout management, data loading coordination, and integration of all visualization components. This component serves as the primary dashboard interface.

## Dependencies
- Provider detail page routing foundation (provider-dashboard-visualizations_routing-foundation)
- Provider metrics calculation system (provider-dashboard-visualizations_metrics-calculation-system)
- shadcn/ui component library (exists)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Main dashboard container renders with proper layout structure
- [ ] Coordinates data loading for all KPI metrics efficiently
- [ ] Implements responsive design across all screen sizes
- [ ] Manages loading states for all child components
- [ ] Handles error states gracefully with user feedback
- [ ] Integrates breadcrumb navigation with back functionality
- [ ] Supports real-time data updates and refreshing
- [ ] Maintains performance with complex visualizations

## Technical Requirements
- Create `src/components/dashboard/provider-kpi-dashboard.tsx` as main container
- Use React Server Components for initial data loading
- Implement compound component pattern (Root, Header, Content)
- Integrate with provider metrics hook for data fetching
- Use shadcn/ui layout components for responsive design
- Add proper TypeScript interfaces for all props
- Implement error boundaries for component isolation
- Use Suspense boundaries for progressive loading

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Dashboard container renders without errors
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- [ ] Loading and error states provide clear user feedback
- [ ] Data loading coordination is efficient and optimized
- [ ] Component follows established patterns and conventions
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes with strict mode
- [ ] Integration tests validate component behavior

## Test Scenarios
**Layout and Responsiveness:**
- Dashboard renders correctly on mobile devices (320px+)
- Tablet layout adapts appropriately (768px+)
- Desktop layout utilizes available space effectively (1024px+)
- Component resizing works smoothly
- Print styles are appropriate if needed

**Data Loading Coordination:**
- Initial data loads efficiently on page render
- Loading states appear immediately and disappear appropriately
- Error states display helpful messages to users
- Data refresh functionality works correctly
- Concurrent data loading doesn't create race conditions

**User Interaction:**
- Breadcrumb navigation functions properly
- Back button integration works correctly
- Component interactions don't interfere with each other
- Accessibility features work for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation is supported

**Performance:**
- Container renders within 1-second target
- Data loading completes within 2-second target
- Component re-renders are optimized
- Memory usage is reasonable with complex data

## Implementation Notes
- Follow existing compound component patterns in codebase
- Use React.Suspense for graceful loading states
- Implement proper error boundaries that don't affect other pages
- Coordinate with TanStack Query for efficient data management
- Design layout to accommodate future KPI additions
- Consider implementing skeleton loading for better UX
- Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for responsive layout
- Add proper ARIA labels for accessibility

## Potential Gotchas
- Coordinate multiple async data sources efficiently
- Handle partial data loading scenarios
- Manage component state during data refreshes
- Responsive layout complexity with multiple charts
- Error boundary placement and scope
- Performance optimization with multiple child components
- Accessibility compliance with complex visualizations
- Integration with existing dashboard navigation
