# Task: Optimize Test Performance and Execution Time

## Description
Optimize the hybrid test suite to meet the 5-minute execution time target. This includes implementing parallel test execution, optimizing browser management, reducing redundant operations, and improving test data setup efficiency.

## Dependencies
- test-suite-modernization_ci-cd-pipeline-update.md
- test-suite-modernization_migrate-server-component-tests.md

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Measure baseline test execution times
- [ ] Implement parallel test execution strategies
- [ ] Optimize browser instance reuse
- [ ] Reduce test data setup overhead
- [ ] Achieve <5 minute total execution time
- [ ] Document performance improvements

## Technical Requirements
- Implementation approach: Systematic performance profiling and optimization
- Performance constraints: Must achieve <5 minute execution time
- Security considerations: Maintain test isolation during optimization

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Test execution time consistently <5 minutes
- [ ] No reduction in test reliability
- [ ] Performance metrics documented
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline optimized

## Test Scenarios
Detailed scenarios that Test Writer should cover:
- Parallel execution doesn't cause conflicts
- Browser reuse doesn't affect test isolation
- Test data caching works correctly
- Resource cleanup happens properly
- Memory usage stays within limits

## Implementation Notes
- Use Playwright test sharding for parallelization
- Implement smart browser context reuse
- Optimize database operations in tests
- Consider test grouping strategies
- Monitor and log execution times
- Create performance benchmarks
